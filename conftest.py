"""Root-level pytest config.

libexec/ scripts now refuse to run without one of CLAUDECODE,
_RAPTOR_TRUSTED, or RAPTOR_DIR set in the environment (see the
trust-marker block at the top of each script). Several test suites
subprocess-invoke libexec scripts and inherit env from this test
runner — set the marker once here so every test is treated as a
trusted caller by default.

Tests that exercise the refusal path explicitly pop the marker from
the subprocess env when they spawn the wrapper.

`RAPTOR_DIR` is also set here. Modules that follow the project's
"hard lookup, no fallbacks" path-safety rule (CLAUDE.md, e.g.
packages/llm_analysis/agent.py) read `os.environ["RAPTOR_DIR"]` at
import time and KeyError if unset. CI runners and developer
shells that don't pre-export RAPTOR_DIR would otherwise fail
test collection. Set it here to the project root (the directory
this conftest.py lives in) so the import-time lookup succeeds
in every test invocation, while production code paths still
require operators to set it explicitly per the launcher rule.

# Darwin-emulation standing gate
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# ``sys.platform`` patched to "darwin" BEFORE collection, so every
# platform-dispatching path — production dispatch, module-level skipif
# conditions, platform-resolved vocabularies — takes its darwin branch
# on a Linux host. That catches the Linux-authored-assertion class (a
# test that encodes the Linux answer for a platform-resolved value) in
# the cheap Linux lane instead of on a macOS runner.
#
# Three effects, all scoped to sessions with the env var set:
#
#  * ``sys.platform`` is patched in pytest_configure — pre-collection,
#    so test modules import after the patch and import-time gates see
#    the emulated platform.
#  * pytest's basetemp is relocated under a darwin-shaped tmp path
#    (…/private/var/folders/…): assertions that substring-match the
#    Linux tmp layout against ``tmp_path``-derived paths fail here
#    instead of on a real mac, where the per-user temp tree
#    legitimately contains "/var/folders". An explicit ``--basetemp``
#    still wins (per-run flags beat the gate). The relocation root
#    carries the reaper-listed ``raptor-pytest-`` prefix so a killed
#    session's leak is reclaimed like any other pytest scratch.
#  * every test marked ``darwin_native`` or ``linux_native``
#    (pytest.ini) is DESELECTED: the markers declare a binding to the
#    real kernel, and emulation must never stack on real kernel
#    behaviour — a monkeypatched darwin shape with the real kernel's
#    own clamp applying underneath measures neither platform.
#
# On native (un-emulated) runs the markers skip honestly instead: an
# item's native markers name the real platforms it can bind to, and a
# host outside that set skips it (a test carrying both markers runs on
# both). Emulation is in-process only — subprocess children observe
# the real platform — which is one more reason real-child tests carry

# resolution failed ran ``git config user.name "Test"`` with the real

# ``.git/config`` (and any other git command — commit, tag,
# ``checkout -b`` — could have hit the real repo the same way).
# Two-sided containment, logic in core/testing/git_hermeticity.py:
#
#  * Env pinning (here, import time, inherited by every subprocess):
#    ``GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL`` / ``GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM`` -> /dev/null and
#    ambient ``GIT_*`` identity/redirection variables stripped, so
#    operator config (init.defaultBranch, commit.gpgsign, an exported
#    GIT_DIR, ...) cannot change test outcomes, and a stray
#    ``git config --global`` from a test can never reach the operator's
#    real config. Forced, not setdefault — hermeticity must hold on
#    every host. A test that genuinely needs the ambient values opts
#    out per-test with ``@pytest.mark.ambient_git_config`` (registered
#    in pytest.ini; nothing needs it today — the marker exists so the
#    next legitimate case doesn't weaken the default).
#
#  * Ambient-config drift guard (pytest_sessionstart /
#    pytest_sessionfinish below): fingerprint the config file(s) a
#    repo-level ``git config`` write from inside this checkout would
#    land in (common-dir config, plus ``config.worktree`` for linked
#    worktrees), re-check at session end, and FAIL the session with a
#    loud summary on drift. Read-only — the guard itself never touches

# SIGKILLed / OOM-killed session leaks every dir live at that moment
# as an anonymous ``$TMP/tmpXXXXXXXX`` nobody can attribute or safely
# sweep (shared multi-session hosts forbid a generic /tmp/tmp* sweep).
#
# Containment instead of per-site chasing: point the session's TMPDIR
# and ``tempfile.tempdir`` at ONE ``core.run.scratch`` dir with the
# reaper-listed ``raptor-pytest-`` prefix. Everything raw tempfile
# creates in-process lands inside it, as does the litter of
# subprocesses that inherit this environment (the mount-ns sandbox
# re-creates ``$TMPDIR`` inside its private tmpfs, step 7b). Children
# spawned through ``get_safe_env()`` are NOT contained — that scrubber
# strips TMPDIR by design (DANGEROUS_ENV_VARS) — which is the status
# quo those tools already handle with their own reaper-listed
# prefixes. Normal exit removes the whole dir; a killed session leaks
# one ``raptor-pytest-*`` dir per pytest process (one per xdist
# worker under ``-n N``), each reclaimed by ``core.run.tmp_reaper``
# past the age floor (swept at every raptor ``start_run`` and once at
# the start of every later test session, below).

# Default-tier slow-test guard
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Preventive backstop for the "a default-tier test is slow because it
# does real I/O it should mock" class — real subprocess / network /
# time.sleep / sandbox setup that turns a 30ms unit test into a 30s one.
# faulthandler_timeout (set in tests.yml) catches a *hang*; this catches
# slow-but-finishes, the day it lands, instead of in a later --durations
# sweep.
#
# Activated ONLY when RAPTOR_MAX_TEST_SECONDS is set — tests.yml sets it
# for the default-tier matrix; nightly.yml deliberately does NOT (its
# `-m "slow or integration"` tests are legitimately slow), and local
# `pytest` is unaffected. The guard FLAGS, it does not kill: every test
# still runs to completion; the session then fails at the end naming the
# offenders, so the signal is "this test got slow", not "killed mid-run".
#
# A genuinely-heavy test is not a bug — mark it @pytest.mark.slow (moves
# it to the nightly tier, out of this guard's scope). A deliberate
# default-tier SENTINEL that must keep running every PR can instead
# carry @pytest.mark.wall_budget(seconds) — a raise-only per-test
# widening of this guard's budget (see the marker block below).

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Randomised test order
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# When RAPTOR_RANDOMISE_TESTS is set (to any value, or a numeric seed),
# randomise the collected test order so order-dependent failures
# surface early.  No external plugin required.
#
# Scope-grouped: the MODULE order is shuffled, then the class-bucket
# order within each module, then the test order within each bucket.  A
# flat item shuffle scattered every module across the session, so
# pytest re-ran module- and class-scoped fixtures once per contiguous
# fragment — observed as 4-6 re-runs of the multi-second audit-prep
# module fixtures per shuffled session (and the same fragmentation for
# expensive class fixtures within their module), a pure fixture-cost
# multiplier on the single-process nightly tier.  Grouping bounds every
# module and class fixture to one setup per session while keeping the
# order-dependence classes the tier has actually caught: cross-module
# state leaks (module order still random), cross-class coupling (class
# order within the module still random), and intra-class coupling
# (item order still random).  What it no longer exercises is one
# scope's test running in the MIDDLE of another scope's fragment —
# pairs of that shape are covered per-worker in the xdist PR tier,
# where distribution interleaves scopes anyway.
#
# Deterministic: same seed → same order.  The seed is printed in the
# terminal header so a failure can be reproduced.

    The emu-root sweep's sibling, same rationale: a KILLED session (or
    worker) never runs the fixture's teardown, and the age-gated
    stale-tmp sweep's 24h floor is far too slow for the worst leaks —
    one killed session left a multi-million-inode build tree that
    exhausted the tmp filesystem's inode table before the gate could
    fire. A dead owning pid marks the session gone; the reaper itself
    gates the verdict (root pid namespace only, mtime age floor — a
    namespaced session's kill() probes call every outer session's
    LIVE pid dead, and this sweep once deleted their scratch under
    the shared /tmp mid-run).

    Runs from ``pytest_configure`` on the CONTROLLER only —
    worker-ness decided from ``config.workerinput`` per this file's
    standing doctrine (a session fixture never executes on an xdist
    controller, and the PYTEST_XDIST_WORKER env var is inheritable by
    nested sessions), and swept over every distinct system tmp root
