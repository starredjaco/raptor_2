# LLM Providers

RAPTOR uses large language models for vulnerability analysis, exploit generation, dataflow
validation, and autonomous decision-making. This guide covers provider configuration,
model selection, multi-model workflows, and cost management.

## Supported Providers

Eight providers are supported. RAPTOR probes for configured providers in this order
and uses the first one found (the resumable Claude Code variant is never
auto-selected — pick it explicitly in `models.json`):

| Provider | Auth | SDK | Default Model |
|----------|------|-----|---------------|
| Anthropic | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | `anthropic` | `claude-opus-4-6` |
| OpenAI | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `openai` | `gpt-5.4` |
| Gemini | `GEMINI_API_KEY` | `google-genai` | `gemini-2.5-pro` |
| Mistral | `MISTRAL_API_KEY` | `openai` | `mistral-large-latest` |
| AWS Bedrock | `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK` or SigV4 chain | `anthropic` + dispatcher | (per config) |
| Ollama | None (local) | `openai` | auto-detected |
| Claude Code | None (`claude` CLI on PATH) | None | (session model) |
| Claude Code (resumable) | None (`claude` CLI on PATH) | None | (session model) |

`claudecode-resumable` (`"provider": "claudecode-resumable"` in
`models.json`) reuses one Claude Code session across calls via
`--resume`, so turn 2+ pays near-zero input cost on long multi-turn
workloads; a stale session resets and retries as fresh.

See [dependencies](dependencies.md) for SDK installation.

### Claude Code transport

When no other provider is configured but the `claude` CLI is on PATH,
RAPTOR dispatches LLM calls through `claude -p` subprocesses. By
default children are pinned via `--model` to the backend-resolved
model identity (see [Model pinning](#model-pinning)); only when the
probe cache is cold or `RAPTOR_CC_PIN_MODEL=0` is set do children
inherit the CLI session's own default (settings.json,
`ANTHROPIC_MODEL`, or the backend's mapping). Because the pinned id
comes from the backend's own result envelope, this works unchanged on
Bedrock/Vertex-backed installs.

Before committing to this transport, `raptor-resolve-mode` runs a
pre-flight probe — one cheap `claude -p` call that confirms the CLI
can actually complete a request and reads the backend-resolved model
from the result envelope. The result is cached for 24 h in
`~/.raptor/cache/cc-probe.json`, keyed on the backend-selection
environment (provider/model/credential/proxy variables and the CLI
binary), so a configuration change forces a fresh probe. On probe
failure RAPTOR falls back to in-session mode rather than dispatching
into a transport whose calls would hang.

Each dispatch carries a per-call abort ceiling (`--max-budget-usd`,
default 5.00 USD). When a call exceeds it, the CLI exits 1 with
`error_max_budget_usd` in its final stream-json event and the call
fails — on pricier backends the biggest call classes (audit Mode 2
checker synthesis) can hit this. Set `RAPTOR_CC_BUDGET_USD` to raise
or lower the ceiling; total run spend is still governed by the
orchestrator-level `--max-cost`.

Timeouts are per call class: the provider default is 600 s, callers
override `timeout_s` per call (checker synthesis uses 1800 s), and
`timeout_s <= 0` means no timeout. Timed-out calls are retried once
by the client (`timeout_retry_cap`, default 1); each call's
disposition lands in `llm-telemetry.jsonl` with its `call_class`.

#### Model pinning

The transport pins children to the backend-resolved model identity
from the pre-flight probe cache, passing it as `--model` explicitly.
This makes the transport deterministic (a mid-run `settings.json`
edit cannot switch models silently), gives the scorecard and cost
tracking a real model name, and lets worker derivation resolve actual
capacity limits. Pinning is backend-safe because the id comes from the
backend's own result envelope. Resolution order: `RAPTOR_CC_MODEL`
(explicit operator pin) → cached probe result → the session default
(probe cache cold, `--model` omitted). `RAPTOR_CC_PIN_MODEL=0`
disables probe pinning.

#### Concurrency

`derive_max_workers` clamps to a subprocess-aware ceiling (default 4,
`RAPTOR_CC_MAX_WORKERS` to change) when the primary model is served
by this transport: each worker is a full CLI process, and N parallel
first calls with an identical prompt prefix race the server-side
prompt cache — each pays the full cache write instead of one writing
and N−1 reading. `tuning.json`'s `max_llm_workers` still beats both.

#### Prompt caching

Server-side prompt caching works ACROSS separate `claude -p`
children: a second call with an identical prefix reads the shared
boot-prompt tokens from cache at a fraction of the cost. Dispatches
keep the CLI's default system prompt byte-stable across working
directories and machines, maximising those hits. Practical
implication: batches of similar calls (audit review loops) should
share one system prompt verbatim and run temporally clustered (the
cache TTL is minutes).

#### Operator knobs (env)

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `RAPTOR_CC_MODEL` | Pin children to this model (`--model`) |
| `RAPTOR_CC_PIN_MODEL=0` | Disable probe-based model pinning |
| `RAPTOR_CC_BUDGET_USD` | Per-call abort ceiling (default 5.00) |
| `RAPTOR_CC_MAX_WORKERS` | Subprocess concurrency cap (default 4) |
| `RAPTOR_CC_EFFORT` | `--effort` for children (low/medium/high/xhigh/max) |
| `RAPTOR_CC_FALLBACK_MODEL` | `--fallback-model`: CLI-native retry on overload |
| `RAPTOR_CC_PROBE_WARM=0` | Skip the run-start probe warm |

#### Security posture

Pure-LLM children run with all internal tools disabled
(`--allowed-tools ""`), zero MCP servers (`--strict-mcp-config` with
an empty config), no session persistence, a sanitised environment
(safe-env baseline + backend auth families only), and a private
mode-0700 neutral working directory — which also means no project
CLAUDE.md, settings, or hooks are loaded. User-level settings still
load (some installs carry backend selection there); restricting
`--setting-sources` further is deliberately NOT done for that reason.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Option 1: Anthropic (recommended)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-...

# Option 2: OpenAI
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Option 3: Ollama (free, local, offline)
# Install Ollama, then:
ollama pull mistral

# Option 4: Gemini
export GEMINI_API_KEY=...

# Verify
python3 raptor.py doctor
```

## AWS Bedrock

Bedrock provides two API surfaces, selectable globally or per-model.

### Mantle (Default)

Endpoint: `bedrock-mantle.<region>.api.aws`. Native Anthropic Messages API with bare
model IDs (e.g. `anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5`). Full feature support: SSE streaming,
tool use, prompt caching, vision, extended thinking.

### Runtime (Legacy)

Endpoint: `bedrock-runtime.<region>.amazonaws.com`. Required for models not yet on
Mantle, cross-region inference profile IDs (`us./eu./au./apac./global.` prefixes), and
compliance-pinned ARN-versioned IDs. Non-streaming only.

### Opt-In

Bedrock is never selected implicitly. Ambient AWS credentials
(`AWS_PROFILE`, a credentials file, an instance role) do not flip
RAPTOR onto the API route — one of these explicit signals does:

- a `models.json` entry resolving to `provider: bedrock` (the primary
  path — see Minimal Configuration below);
- `RAPTOR_BEDROCK_MODEL=<id>` or `RAPTOR_BEDROCK_PROFILE=<name>` for
  env-driven one-shot runs;
- `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK` (bearer auth is its own statement of
  intent).

Once opted in, ambient credentials *gate* the route (an entry without
any resolvable credential stays unusable) but never *select* it.

### Authentication

| Mode | Environment / config | Notes |
|------|----------------------|-------|
| Bearer token | `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK`, `AWS_REGION` | No SDK dependency. JWT-shaped tokens get expiry countdown warnings; an expired token falls back to SigV4 when the chain resolves (one warning), else 401s with rotation guidance. |
| SigV4 — profile / role | `AWS_PROFILE` or `RAPTOR_BEDROCK_PROFILE` (or per-entry `aws_profile`) | Recommended on AWS compute: no secret at rest, auto-refreshing (SSO / assume-role / IMDS), least-privilege scoping. Needs `botocore` in the parent. |
| SigV4 — static keys | `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION` | Standing secret; prefer a profile. Needs `botocore` (installing `boto3` also works — it includes `botocore`). |

`RAPTOR_BEDROCK_PROFILE` outranks the ambient `AWS_PROFILE`, and a
per-entry `aws_profile` pin outranks both — an entry-pinned profile
also **forces SigV4 for that entry** even when a bearer token is
present (the pin chooses which identity signs; a bearer has no
identity choice). All credential resolution and signing happen in the
dispatcher parent; workers never hold AWS credentials.

### Minimal Configuration

On a box where Claude Code itself runs against Bedrock, the working
CC session is live proof of a valid surface/model/entitlement
combination — so the minimal entry:

```json
{"models": [{"provider": "bedrock"}]}
```

backfills the surface from `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_MANTLE` and the model
from the cc-probe cache (backend-resolved; authoritative) falling
back to `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`. Backfill is same-surface only (bare vs
prefixed id shapes differ per surface) and never happens when CC is
on the direct Anthropic API — its model id is the wrong shape for
Bedrock. Explicit entry fields always win; a fully-specified entry
ignores CC entirely.

A role-less Bedrock entry is the declared default for all API work
(the standard first-entry convention). Give it `"role": "fallback"`
(or any auxiliary role) to keep primary selection unchanged.

### Region

One region value drives both the endpoint hostname and the SigV4
signing scope (they must agree). Resolution, most specific first:

1. `region` field on the entry
2. `RAPTOR_BEDROCK_REGION`
3. entry-pinned `aws_profile`'s own configured region (the pin serves
   the entry; the env serves the box)
4. ambient `AWS_REGION` / `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`
5. the credential chain's region
6. fail with a no-region diagnostic — never a silent default

Two entries may pin different regions in one run (per-request
signing). Since Bedrock quotas are per-account-per-region, pinning
RAPTOR's entry to a different region than an interactive Claude Code
session is the clean way to stop them competing for headroom.

### Model IDs Per Surface

Mantle accepts **only bare** `<provider>.<model>` ids; RAPTOR
normalizes losslessly at config time (peels a regional prefix,
prepends the provider segment for bare catalog names). Runtime ids
pass verbatim — prefixed inference profiles, versioned ids and ARNs
are all legal there — with a loud warning when a geographic prefix
contradicts the configured region.

### Operational Guards

- **Worker cap:** Bedrock quota is shared account-wide (most visibly
  with a live Claude Code session on the same account), so analysis
  parallelism is clamped to 8 workers by default. The cap is
  posture-aware: `tuning.json`'s `llm_account_posture=solo` raises it
  to 16 (the account is declared this host's alone — still a ceiling,
  since bursting past the quota's token-rate churns 429s even solo).
  `RAPTOR_BEDROCK_MAX_WORKERS` overrides posture in both directions,
  `tuning.json`'s `max_llm_workers` beats everything.
- **Entitlement preflight:** at dispatcher startup, one 1-token probe
  per configured (model, surface, region, profile) combination turns
  an un-entitled model into an actionable warning up front instead of
  an AccessDenied mid-run. Successes cache for 24h; failures re-probe
  next run; network problems never warn or block.
- **Streaming:** Mantle streams natively; the runtime surface is
  non-streaming (InvokeModel) — selecting it logs the capability
  limit at construction time. `RAPTOR_LLM_STREAM_TRANSPORT=1` carries
  otherwise-non-streaming calls (plain generation AND instructor
  structured generation) over SSE — see Long Structured Calls below.
- **Multi-model panels:** two entries that peel to the same
  underlying model (e.g. a Bedrock id and its direct-API name) log a
  same-weights warning — their agreement is transport consistency,
  not independent consensus.

### Long Structured Calls

SDK structured generation is non-streaming, and upstream providers
abort non-streaming requests whose generation runs long (Anthropic
documents roughly a ten-minute ceiling). A structured call that asks a
thinking model for a large response — study batches are the canonical
case — can therefore die in transport no matter how generous the local
timeouts are. Symptoms: `InstructorRetryException: Request timed out
or interrupted`, paired with dispatcher `ReadError`/`BrokenPipeError`
noise.

Two fixes, layered:

- **Per-call opt-in:** callers that know their response is long pass
  `stream=True` to `generate_structured` (or `generate`) — that one
  call rides `messages.stream` + `get_final_message()`, so the
  upstream ceiling no longer applies. Study Phase 2 batches and the
  threat-frame derivation opt in automatically. On SSE-incapable
  surfaces (Bedrock runtime) the opt-in degrades silently to plain
  `create` — pipeline callers are blind to the deployment's surface
  and must not 400 it.
- **Deployment-wide:** `RAPTOR_LLM_STREAM_TRANSPORT=1` (see the
  streaming bullet under Operational Guards) carries every
  otherwise-non-streaming call over SSE, including instructor's
  structured leg. Deliberately loud on a non-streaming surface — the
  operator opted in explicitly.

Complementary bounds, useful with or without the streaming transport:

1. **Bound the response.** Callers may pass a per-call `max_tokens` to
   `generate_structured` (the config ceiling is a default, not a
   floor). The study pipeline caps its batches via
   `RAPTOR_STUDY_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` (default 16384).
2. **Bound the request.** Smaller batches produce smaller responses —
   the study pipeline's `--batch-target` controls items per LLM call,
   and oversized single-file groups are split to honour it.
3. **Switch transport.** The Claude Code provider (`--model
   claudecode`) streams internally via the CLI, so the non-streaming
   ceiling does not apply regardless of the env knob.

### Standalone CLIs

The Bedrock provider is dispatcher-only. Pipeline runs get the
dispatcher from the launcher; standalone CLIs whose LLM call happens
in the invoking process (`raptor-llm-ask`) self-serve an in-process
dispatcher automatically. `raptor-llm-ask` also defaults to the
configured model when `--model` is omitted — with the minimal entry
above, `/ask <prompt>` just works.

### Switching API Surface

```bash
# Globally per run
export RAPTOR_BEDROCK_API=mantle    # default
export RAPTOR_BEDROCK_API=runtime

# Per model in models.json (always wins over env var)
{"provider": "bedrock", "model": "us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0", "bedrock_api": "runtime"}
```

A geo-prefixed model id (`us.anthropic.*` etc.) infers `provider: bedrock` but
still defaults to Mantle — select Runtime explicitly via `bedrock_api` or
`RAPTOR_BEDROCK_API`. Mantle handles regional routing at the hostname layer.

## Model Configuration

### models.json

Location: `~/.config/raptor/models.json` (override with `RAPTOR_CONFIG`). Supports
`//` line comments.

```json
{
  "models": [
    {
      "provider": "anthropic",
      "model": "claude-opus-4-6",
      "role": "analysis",
      "max_context": 1000000,
      "max_output": 128000,
      "timeout": 120
    },
    {
      "provider": "anthropic",
      "model": "claude-haiku-4-5",
      "role": "fallback"
    },
    {
      "provider": "bedrock",
      "model": "anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5",
      "bedrock_api": "mantle"
    }
  ]
}
```

Entry fields:

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `provider` | No | Inferred from model name if unambiguous (`claude-*` = anthropic, `gpt-*` = openai, `us.anthropic.*` / `anthropic.*` = bedrock) |
| `model` | Mostly | Model identifier. Anthropic aliases auto-resolve to dated snapshots. Optional for `bedrock` (backfilled — see Minimal Configuration) and `claudecode` (session default). |
| `api_key` | No | Falls back to provider env var. Not needed for Bedrock SigV4 (the dispatcher signs) or claudecode (the CLI authenticates itself). |
| `role` | No | `analysis`, `code`, `consensus`, `fallback`, `judge`, `aggregate` |
| `max_context` | No | Context window size (tokens) |
| `max_output` | No | Maximum output tokens |
| `timeout` | No | Request timeout (seconds) |
| `bedrock_api` | No | `mantle` or `runtime` (Bedrock only) |
| `aws_profile` | No | Signing profile name for this entry (Bedrock only; non-secret). Forces SigV4 for the entry and outranks env profiles. |
| `region` | No | Endpoint + signing region for this entry (Bedrock only). See the Region ladder. |

A `{"provider": "claudecode", "role": "fallback"}` entry declares the
Claude Code CLI transport as an explicit safety net behind an API
primary — resolvable whenever the `claude` binary is installed.

### Model Selection Logic

1. `--model <name>` on CLI pins a specific model (bypasses auto-selection).
2. Operator `models.json` entries are scored by tier (Opus > GPT-5.4-pro > o3 > Sonnet > Gemini Pro).
   A Bedrock entry without an auxiliary role gets its own step here —
   the tier table can't score Bedrock ids, so the entry itself is the
   declared default for API work.
3. The same goes for Ollama. The tier table only knows the closed
   cloud models, so a local entry would never score — a role-less (or
   `analysis`/`code`-role) Ollama entry therefore gets its own step,
   and the first such entry in the file is the declared default. This
   is what lets `models.json` pin *which* local model is primary rather
   than leaving it to the `/api/tags` probe order below. Give it an
   auxiliary role (`fallback`, `judge`, etc.) to keep it out of primary
   selection.
4. Provider auto-detect: first configured provider in the default order
   wins. For Ollama with no primary-eligible entry, this falls through
   to the probe's own preference order (see [Ollama](#ollama-offline--airgapped)).
5. Shorthand resolution: bare tokens like `haiku`, `opus`, `sonnet` match against
   configured model names. Ambiguous matches raise an error.

### Fast-Tier Models

Certain task types (`verdict_binary`, `classify`) automatically use cheaper models:

| Provider | Fast-Tier Model |
|----------|----------------|
| Anthropic | `claude-haiku-4-5` |
| OpenAI | `gpt-4o-mini` |
| Gemini | `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` |
| Mistral | `mistral-small-latest` |

## Multi-Model Workflows

The [/agentic](commands.md#agentic) and [/analyze](commands.md#analyze)
commands support multi-model configurations via repeatable flags (for
multi-model verdicts on CodeQL findings, run `/agentic` or `/analyze`
over the CodeQL SARIF):

| Flag | Role | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `--model MODEL` | Analysis | Repeatable. Each model independently analyses every finding in parallel. Results are then correlated. |
| `--consensus MODEL` | Blind second opinion | Receives the same finding independently, never sees the primary's output. Measures agreement. |
| `--judge MODEL` | Non-blind review | Sees the primary's analysis and the finding, then renders a verdict. Runs after primary analysis. |
| `--aggregate MODEL` | Final synthesis | Receives merged results from all models plus correlation data. Produces a single consolidated output. Only one allowed. |

Constraints: consensus/judge/aggregate require at least one analysis model. The same
model cannot serve as both analysis and consensus.

Correlation notes: a finding where every model abstained
(errored/refused) carries the `no-verdict` confidence signal in
`correlation.json` — abstentions never count as votes, so an
all-abstain panel is never reported as unanimous. A model's failure
circuit breaker also opens after ten consecutive failures even when
the model succeeded earlier in the run (one early success previously
held a dying transport closed for the rest of the work items).

Example:
```bash
/agentic ~/target \
  --model claude-opus-4-6 \
  --model gpt-5.4 \
  --consensus claude-haiku-4-5 \
  --judge claude-opus-4-6
```

## Scorecard

The model scorecard (`out/llm_scorecard.json`) tracks per-model reliability across
decision classes (e.g. `codeql:py/sql-injection`). See [/scorecard](commands.md#scorecard)
for the operator CLI.

### How It Works

- **Wilson confidence bound**: calculates upper-bound miss rate from correct/incorrect
  counts. Models below threshold are "trusted" for that decision class.
- **Short-circuit**: when a cheap-tier model has a trusted scorecard cell, the full
  analysis call to the flagship model is skipped. Cost savings reported at run end.
- **Shadow rate** (default 5%): trusted cells randomly run full analysis to detect
  model drift.
- **Freshness weighting**: optional age-weighted observations so recent data dominates.
- **Schema validity**: every `generate_structured` call records pass/fail under a
  `_structured` decision class.
- **Integrity (HMAC provenance)**: the sidecar steers routing, so every write stamps
  it with an HMAC-SHA256 token keyed from
  `$XDG_DATA_HOME/raptor/scorecard-mac.key` (default
  `~/.local/share/raptor/scorecard-mac.key`; its own per-purpose key -- never
  `rowmac.key` or `telemetry-mac.key`). Reads verify before acting: unverified
  content (tampered, or genuine pre-MAC history) never steers routing and never gets
  re-stamped -- it is discarded in memory and quarantined to
  `<sidecar>.unverified` on the next write. Re-bless genuine history deliberately
  with `raptor-llm-scorecard adopt`. With an unusable key (symlinked,
  foreign-owned, unwritable data dir) the content stays readable but the trust
  surface clamps: no short-circuit, `force_short_circuit` pins not honoured.

### Producers

Beyond per-call recording, four producers run at analysis time:

| Producer | What it measures |
|----------|-----------------|
| Cross-run stability | Same finding across runs -- flags models whose verdict flips |
| Cross-family check | Agreement between models from different providers on the same finding |
| Self-consistency | Same model, same finding, different prompt framings -- catches prompt-sensitive models |
| Dataflow validation | Alignment between the model's verdict and the mechanical dataflow evidence |

Controlled by `LLMConfig.scorecard_enabled` (default `True`).

## Cost Management

### Budget Cap

`LLMConfig.max_cost_per_scan` sets a USD budget cap (default $10.00). Enforced via
atomic pre-debit reservation before each provider call. Concurrent dispatchers cannot
race past the cap. Override with `--max-cost-usd` on the CLI.

**Note:** there is no `RAPTOR_MAX_COST` environment variable — no code reads it.
The budget cap is set via `--max-cost-usd` (CLI), `max_cost_per_scan` (config), or —
for runs that configure no cap at all — the tuning.json default ceiling below.

### Default Ceiling for Uncapped Runs

Some entry points express "no cap" as `max_cost_per_scan = float('inf')` (the audit
pipeline without `--max-cost`, `/agentic`'s audit post-pass when no `--max-cost-usd`
was given). At first dispatch the client resolves the run's ceiling once:

- `default_max_cost_usd` in `tuning.json`, when set, applies to an uncapped run
  exactly as if passed on the CLI. A CLI/programmatic cap always wins — the knob is
  only consulted when nothing else set a cap.
- With no knob, the run **stays uncapped** (no hard default is ever imposed) and a
  single prominent warning banner names the cap flags and the knob.

Invalid knob values (non-numeric, non-finite, zero/negative) are ignored — the run
stays uncapped with the banner, never surprise-capped at zero.
`enable_cost_tracking=False` is a deliberate programmatic opt-out of all spend
accounting and bypasses both the knob and the banner.

### Degraded-Mode Breaker

Budget caps bound *total* spend; the run-level degraded-mode breaker
(`core/llm/breaker.py`) bounds spend on *failure*. It watches a sliding window of
provider outcomes across the whole process, and when transport-class failures
(timeouts, wire/5xx errors and response-shape failures, mid-response deaths) make up
a sustained majority of recent attempts — a provider brown-out, or a systematic
`max_tokens`-truncation loop — it latches and every new LLM dispatch raises
`LLMDegradedModeError`. That error is a subclass of `LLMBudgetExceededError`, so the
run stops on the same graceful contract as budget exhaustion: loop drivers stop
dispatching, in-flight calls drain, run state and per-attempt spend evidence persist,
and the trip verdict (dominant failure class, window stats) is appended to the run's
`llm-telemetry.jsonl`.

The breaker deliberately does **not** trip on:

- model refusals / content filters (`blocked`) — a hostile corpus legitimately
  drives those, and they must not become a denial-of-analysis lever;
- 429s (`quota`) — the adaptive throttle and daily-quota latch own that lane;
- auth failures — the consecutive-auth-streak tracker aborts the phase;
- short bursts (a minimum sustain span) or low-volume runs (a minimum-sample floor).

Two accepted subtleties: response-shape failures (malformed JSON, schema
violations) count as `retryable`, so a corpus that steers the model into
systematic non-JSON output *can* contribute to the fraction — the deliberate
price of catching the truncation-loop class; the refusal exclusion narrows the
denial-of-analysis lever rather than fully closing it. And the fraction is
per-*attempt*, not per-call: a dead primary whose retries all fail can trip the
breaker even while calls complete through a healthy fallback — a run burning
several failed attempts per completed call is degradation an operator should
rule on.

Thresholds default to: failure fraction 0.5 over a 10-minute window, minimum 20
outcomes, sustained for at least 5 minutes. Each is env-overridable
(`RAPTOR_LLM_BREAKER_THRESHOLD` / `_WINDOW_S` / `_MIN_SAMPLES` / `_SUSTAIN_S`), and
`RAPTOR_LLM_BREAKER=0` disables the breaker for a run — see
[Environment Variables](environment.md).

### Token Pricing

Per-1K-token input/output rates are maintained in `core/llm/model_data.py` for every
known model, verified against provider pricing pages. Includes:

- Bedrock cross-region surcharge (10%, applied to geo-prefixed models with a
  confirmed `global.` cross-region SKU; other geo prefixes stay at 1.0x)
- Anthropic cache pricing (1.25x input for 5-minute cache writes, 2.0x for
  1-hour cache writes, 0.1x for cache reads)
- Thinking/reasoning tokens billed at output rate across all providers

Unknown models log a warning and record $0 cost (budget caps silently defeated).

### Viewing Costs

Costs are reported at the end of each run. The scorecard also tracks cumulative
per-model cost and token usage.

## Transcript Record / Replay

The transcript seam (`core/llm/transcript.py`) freezes a run's LLM
behaviour so the detection pipeline can be re-run against it
hermetically — no network, no cost, deterministic. This is the
substrate for detection-quality evals in CI: record once on a live
run, then replay the frozen responses through *new* pipeline code.

```bash
# Record: a normal (paid) run, plus a JSONL transcript in the run dir
RAPTOR_LLM_TRANSCRIPT=record:out/myrun/llm-transcript.jsonl \
    python3 raptor.py analyze --sarif findings.sarif ...

# Replay: the same analysis, served entirely from the transcript.
# Needs NO provider configuration or credentials.
RAPTOR_LLM_TRANSCRIPT=replay:out/myrun/llm-transcript.jsonl \
    python3 raptor.py analyze --sarif findings.sarif ...
```

How it works:

- **Record** wraps `LLMClient.generate` / `generate_structured` (the
  same chokepoint the response cache intercepts) and appends every
  request/response pair — and every failure, so replay stays
  sequence-faithful — to the trail. All recorded strings are
  secret-redacted at write time; prompts are stored as hashes plus a
  bounded diagnostic excerpt, never in full.
- **Replay** serves recorded responses before model resolution — no
  provider is ever constructed, and provider dispatch is hard-blocked.
  Matching survives prompt-template drift and queue re-ordering:
  exact prompt/schema hashes first, then the per-finding subject tag
  the analysis loop declares, then recorded order within the call
  class — positionally, a tagged entry never serves a different
  subject (a new finding misses instead of stealing its neighbour's
  verdict). An unmatched call fails loudly with a structured miss
  report (at the /analyze surface it lands as that finding's
  error-status record); it never falls through to a live provider.
  An eval harness should fail on all three signals: misses
  (`session.misses`), error-status findings, and leftovers — recorded
  entries the replay never consumed (`session.leftover_report()`),
  which mean the replay run issued fewer calls than the recorded one.
- Dispatch surfaces not yet transcript-adopted (the orchestrated
  multi-model path, the ranking stage) refuse under replay with a
  clear error and warn under record that the transcript will
  under-record — they never silently dispatch live during a replay.
- Replayed structured responses re-run the strict schema floor
  against the current schema and flow through the same downstream
  validation as live responses — transcript content is treated as
  untrusted, exactly like model output.

Scope: the seam covers clients constructed through
`core.llm.factory.get_client` and the /analyze agent. A replayed
response that originally contained a secret comes back with the
redaction placeholder — evals score verdict fields, not echoed
secrets.

## Rate Limiting

RAPTOR adapts dispatch concurrency to each provider's rate limits.  The
throttle (`core/llm/throttle.py`) tracks per-model request and token
rates, backs off on 429 responses, and resumes at the observed
sustainable rate.  The concurrency controller (`core/llm/concurrency.py`)
derives `max_parallel` from the model's known RPM (requests per minute),
so a provider with a 60 RPM cap does not get 16 concurrent requests.

No operator configuration is needed — the defaults adapt automatically.
If a provider is consistently throttled, RAPTOR logs the effective rate
at run end.


## Credential Isolation

The LLM dispatcher (`core/llm/dispatcher/`) holds API keys in the parent process only.
Worker processes communicate via Unix domain socket (`RAPTOR_LLM_SOCKET`). The parent's
`CredentialStore` reads and removes sensitive environment variables so sandboxed workers
never see them.

This is automatic when running via `bin/raptor`. Direct `python3 raptor.py` invocations
hold keys in-process.

## Ollama (Offline / Airgapped)

Ollama auto-detection probes `$OLLAMA_HOST/api/tags` (2-second timeout). If no
`OLLAMA_HOST` is set, it defaults to `http://localhost:11434`.

Preferred auto-selection order: mistral > qwen > codellama > llama > gemma >
deepseek-coder > deepseek.

Models that reject tool/function calling are auto-detected at runtime and silently
fall back to JSON-in-prompt synthesis.

### Pinning which local model is primary

Auto-detection is a convenience, not a choice — on a box with several
models pulled it picks the first one matching the preference order
above, which is rarely the one you want driving a run. To decide
explicitly, name the models in `models.json`. The first role-less (or
`analysis`/`code`-role) Ollama entry becomes the primary; everything
else is an auxiliary:

```json
{
  "models": [
    { "provider": "ollama", "model": "qwen3-27b", "max_context": 60000, "max_output": 8192 },
    { "provider": "ollama", "model": "qwen3-coder", "role": "code",     "max_context": 60000, "max_output": 8192 },
    { "provider": "ollama", "model": "qwen3-122b",  "role": "judge",    "max_context": 30000, "max_output": 8192 }
  ]
}
```

Here `qwen3-27b` is the primary, the coder model is seated as the
`code` specialist, and the big model is held back as a `judge` for
multi-model review rather than becoming the everyday default. Confirm
what a run will actually resolve to with:

```bash
libexec/raptor-llm-ask --show-primary
```

Two things worth knowing, both of which bite on a multi-model box:

- **Context sizing is yours to declare.** An Ollama model absent from
  the built-in catalogue defaults to a conservative 32k context. If the
  model serves more, set `max_context`/`max_output` on the entry — and
  make sure the server actually grants it. Ollama caps the window at
  `num_ctx` (default 2048, or whatever `OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH` is set
  to), independent of what the model was trained for; a prompt that
  exceeds the served window comes back empty. Keep `max_context` at or
  below the server's `num_ctx`, raising `num_ctx` (a per-model
  Modelfile `PARAMETER`, or the server env var) to match.
- **Reference the model by the exact name in the entry.** `--model`
  matches against your configured names, so `--model qwen3-27b` works;
  a `provider/model`-prefixed form (`ollama/qwen3-27b`) is not needed
  and currently routes less reliably — prefer the bare name.

### Quality Tradeoffs

Reliability tracks model scale and quantization, not the Ollama transport itself.
A frontier-scale open-weight model (100B+ parameters, Q8/FP8 or better, full
context) is a different proposition than a small, heavily-quantized, or
safety-ablated ("abliterated") fine-tune — the table below is a starting
expectation, not a fixed rule for "local" as a category:

| Capability | Frontier closed models | Local (Ollama) |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Vulnerability analysis | Excellent | Good to excellent — scales with model size |
| Exploitability triage | Excellent | Good to excellent — scales with model size |
| Exploit code generation | Compilable, working C | Varies widely — large models at high precision can be competitive; small, quantized, or ablated models often produce invalid assembly or non-existent libc calls |
| Dataflow validation | Accurate | Good for large models; smaller ones are more prone to hallucination |
| Cost | ~$0.01/finding | Free |

Exploit-dev precision (exact offsets, gadget addresses, byte-accurate
shellcode) is a narrow domain most training data underrepresents, open or
closed — expect a real gap there even from strong open models, and treat
generated PoCs as a draft to verify rather than ground truth, regardless of
provider.

Don't take this table's word for it, either: RAPTOR's model scorecard
(`/scorecard`, or `libexec/raptor-llm-scorecard list`) tracks real per-model
pass/fail data — including a `_structured` decision class for schema
validity — so after a few runs you can check what your specific model is
actually achieving instead of relying on defaults.

## Gemini

Full native support via the `google-genai` SDK (`GeminiProvider`). Features include
native schema-constrained JSON output and accurate thinking-token tracking. Falls back
to OpenAI-compatible mode when the `google-genai` SDK is not installed (loses thinking-token
granularity).

Security-analysis prompts routinely discuss exploits, so every native-SDK call
disables the dangerous-content safety filter (`HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT:
BLOCK_NONE`); if a response is still blocked, the block reason is surfaced in the
error. Truncated native structured responses (output cut mid-JSON) are detected
and raised rather than returned as silently-corrupt data.

## HTTP Transport Tuning

The in-process SDK transports (anthropic, openai, google-genai — all
httpx-based) use a shared pooled-client factory (`core/llm/http_pool.py`)
whose idle keepalive outlives the think-time gap between LLM calls.
httpx's default pool expires idle connections after 5 seconds, so
without this nearly every call re-establishes its connection — cheap on
a direct network, but behind the egress chokepoint chained to a
corporate proxy each re-establishment pays TCP + CONNECT negotiation
per hop plus the TLS handshake. Defaults: 60 s keepalive, 20 pooled
idle connections, 100 total. Tune with `RAPTOR_HTTP_KEEPALIVE_S`,
`RAPTOR_HTTP_MAX_KEEPALIVE`, `RAPTOR_HTTP_MAX_CONNECTIONS`.

`RAPTOR_HTTP2=1` opts the pooled transports into HTTP/2 (requires
`pip install h2`; warns once and stays on HTTP/1.1 when missing).
All concurrent calls then multiplex over a single connection — one
CONNECT chain and one TLS handshake total, which is the biggest
wall-clock win for high-concurrency runs behind chained proxies.
Off by default: TCP head-of-line blocking stalls every multiplexed
stream on one lost packet, and some middleboxes misbehave on
long-lived multiplexed tunnels — enable per-deployment and verify.

`RAPTOR_LLM_STREAM_TRANSPORT=1` carries non-streaming Anthropic calls
over the SDK's streaming transport (`messages.stream` +
`get_final_message()` — the identical response object, so parsing is
unchanged). Use it behind corporate proxies that idle-kill tunnels
carrying no bytes: a thinking model is silent for minutes on a
non-streamed call, while SSE keeps bytes flowing for the whole
generation. TCP keepalive does not cover this case (probes are not
tunnel payload). Off by default so proxied hosts don't silently
exercise different code paths than direct hosts; the task-budget
beta endpoint always stays on plain `create`.

### Choosing the knobs

The defaults are chosen so the pure-win changes need no opt-in and
the two transports with real failure modes need a deliberate one:

- **Keepalive (default 60 s)** must outlive the think-time gap
  between calls but stay inside middlebox idle-kill horizons (squid's
  default `read_timeout` is 15 minutes; NAT tables usually 5+). The
  default sits well inside both bounds — tune only if your proxy's
  idle timer is unusually tight. Raising it far is harmless but
  useless: the knob is a local pool ceiling, not a path guarantee.
  On a measured proxied path, idle connections always survived
  300 s gaps and never survived 600 s — identically with TCP
  keepalives armed and unarmed, because keepalive probes are not
  tunnel payload and do not reset middlebox idle timers. Past the
  path's window the middlebox expires the connection first, and the
  pool re-dials transparently at the cost of roughly one TLS
  handshake after the silence.
- **HTTP/2** is a per-deployment, evidence-based opt-in. A clean
  sequential smoke test is *not* sufficient evidence — the risk cases
  are multiplexed concurrency under packet loss (TCP head-of-line
  blocking stalls every stream at once) and middleboxes that
  misbehave on long-lived multiplexed tunnels. Soak it on a real
  concurrent run (e.g. `/agentic`) before pinning it in the launcher
  environment. Do not enable it behind a TLS-intercepting
  (`ssl_bump`-style) proxy — ALPN then terminates at the proxy.
- **Stream transport** only pays off when the upstream proxy's
  idle timer on relayed bytes is *shorter* than your longest model
  silence. Check the proxy config first (`read_timeout` on squid);
  with the common defaults it buys nothing and just moves you onto
  the less-travelled code path.
- **`RAPTOR_PROXY_UPSTREAM_HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT_S`** stays at 10 s so a
  dead proxy fails fast. Widen it only on evidence: `upstream_failed`
  events with handshake reasons in `proxy-events.jsonl`.

### Verifying the transport behaviour

- **Connection reuse:** count tunnels per call. Every CONNECT through
  the egress chokepoint is one record in the run's
  `proxy-events.jsonl`; a healthy pooled transport opens one tunnel
  per provider host per run (plus one STS tunnel on SigV4 routes),
  not one per call.
- **TCP keepalive:** `ss -tno` during a run shows
  `timer:(keepalive,…)` on the established legs toward the upstream
  proxy.
- **Negotiated protocol:** with `RAPTOR_HTTP2=1`, httpx keeps proxied
  connections under the client's proxy *mounts* (not the default
  transport pool); their `info()` strings report `HTTP/2` once a
  request has flowed.
- **Benchmarking pitfalls:** vary prompts with a per-run nonce — or set
  `RAPTOR_LLM_CACHE=off` — otherwise the LLM response cache serves
  repeats in ~1 ms and fakes a win; and
  give thinking-tier models an adequate `max_tokens` — a tiny budget
  is consumed by the thinking block and returns zero text with
  `stop_reason=max_tokens`.
