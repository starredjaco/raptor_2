RAPTOR Truly Agentic Workflow

Complete end-to-end autonomous security testing:
0. Pre-exploit mitigation analysis (optional)
1. Scan code with Semgrep and CodeQL (parallel)
2. Validate exploitability (filter false positives and unreachable code)
3. Analyse each finding (read code, understand context, assess impact)
4. Generate exploit PoCs for confirmed vulnerabilities
5. Create secure patches
6. Cross-finding analysis (structural grouping, shared root causes)
7. Multi-model consensus (when configured)
8. Report everything
