    """Compute the ``rules_applied`` list stored on the semgrep
    coverage record.

    Captures every policy group whose registry pack actually ran,
    so the coverage report's "policy group(s) not used" check
    (``POLICY_GROUP_TO_SEMGREP_PACK.keys() - rules_applied``)
    doesn't falsely flag groups whose pack was added via the
    catalog, via a rule-dir-name match, or as a shared pack id
    across multiple policy groups.

    Pre-fix: ``rules_applied=['all']`` (literal) or local rule
    directory names; both lacked the canonical policy-group keys,
    so EVERY policy group showed as ''not used'' — the
    operator-facing inconsistency the c.userspace-daemon scan
    surfaced.

    Honest semantic: pack-id-driven. A policy group is ''applied''
    iff its registry pack id is in the set of pack ids semgrep
    actually ran. That set is the union of:

    * Catalog-resolved baseline packs (``resolved_baseline``).
    * Pack ids that ``semgrep_scan_parallel`` adds because a
      rule dir's name matched a key in ``POLICY_GROUP_TO_SEMGREP_PACK``
      (see scanner.py:``Add corresponding standard pack if available``).

    Operator-passed specific policy groups (``--policy-groups
    auth,injection``) drive ``rules_dirs`` membership, which feeds
    back through the same rule-dir → pack-id mapping — so the
    set inclusion is automatic; no special branch needed.

    Two correctness wins over the pre-fix design:

    1. Shared pack ids — ``flows`` and ``best-practices`` both
       map to ``p/default``; running ``flows/`` exercises both,
       and both correctly land in ``applied`` here.
    2. No-local-rule-dir groups — ``best-practices`` has no
       local rule dir; ``--policy-groups all`` doesn't trigger
       its registry pack via the rule-dir loop, so it's NOT in
       ``applied`` unless something else added ``p/default``
       (which ``flows/`` does in practice).

    * ``groups`` — accepted for API symmetry / future extension;
      currently unused (rule-dir membership is the actual signal).
    * ``resolved_baseline`` — the catalog-resolved baseline pack
      set (``[(display_name, pack_id), ...]``).
    * ``rules_dirs`` — local rule directory paths the scanner
      passed to semgrep_scan_parallel. Used to derive which
      registry packs got auto-added via the rule-dir → pack-id
      mapping, AND as the fallback identity when nothing else

    # HOME + XDG basedirs are redirected via the sandbox layer's

    # sandbox itself owns the override semantics: it pre-creates
    # ``HOME`` + all four ``XDG_*_HOME`` subdirs (CONFIG/DATA/CACHE/STATE)
    # with mode 0o700 inside ``output``, refuses to materialise if any
    # target path is a symlink (TOCTOU defence against a prior sandboxed
    # child substituting a redirect target), and merges the override
    # into the subprocess env with ``fake_home_env`` winning over any
    # caller-supplied ``env=`` (see ``core/sandbox/context.py``).
    #
    # Without the XDG override, ``SAFE_ENV_ALLOWLIST`` preserves the
    # operator's ``XDG_CONFIG_HOME`` and newer semgrep follows it to the
    # real ``~/.config/semgrep`` — outside the Landlock writable policy.
    # Under full sandbox the path is invisible inside the mount-ns;
    # under the rootless-podman / distrobox Landlock-only path Landlock
    # denies the write and semgrep crashes. ``fake_home=True`` is the
    # profile-agnostic fix and means the policy lives in ONE place
    # (sandbox context) instead of hand-rolled per-tool.

    # semgrep 1.79.0 does NOT persistently cache registry packs on disk

    # under engine/semgrep/rules/registry-cache/ and rewrites
    # ``p/security-audit`` → local path BEFORE semgrep's registry client
    # runs — post-#196 the fetch path is cold.

    # Registry packs ("p/xxx", "category/xxx") fetch YAML from semgrep.dev
    # on every invocation — semgrep has no persistent on-disk cache. A slow
    # or stalled registry fetch otherwise consumes the full SEMGREP_TIMEOUT
    # (15 min) per pack, and at MAX_SEMGREP_WORKERS=4 can eat the whole
    # 30-min agentic budget for one bad network moment. Bound the per-pack
    # cost with a tighter ceiling so a stuck fetch drops that pack and the
    # remaining packs still run. Local rule directories keep the longer

    Pre-unification this module shipped its own ~80-LOC WIP CodeQL
    runner alongside the proper one in `packages/codeql/`. The two
    diverged: the in-tree runner had no auto-detection (operator
    had to hard-code the language list), no build-system detection
    or synthesis (compiled C/C++ projects without a Makefile got
    silent extraction failures), no content-addressed DB cache, no
    target-repo trust check, no language alias normalisation
    (PR #448), and a hard-coded query-dir path that broke if the
    operator wasn't standing in repo root. The packages/codeql/
    runner has all of those.

    The two paths converge here: scanner.py invokes the proper
    agent as a subprocess (mirroring how raptor_agentic.py runs it
    at line 743). Output naming is identical — the agent writes
    `codeql_<lang>.sarif` per detected language under `out_dir`,
    matching the previous in-tree runner's convention so downstream
    consumers (SARIF merge, coverage records) are unchanged.

    Args:
        repo_path: Repository to scan.
        out_dir: Directory for SARIF + report outputs.
        languages: Explicit language list. None ⇒ auto-detect
            (recommended; the agent picks up everything in the
            repo and skips empty languages, vs the pre-unification
            "always create cpp/java/python/go DBs whether the repo
            has those files or not" approach).
        build_command: Optional CodeQL build command override
            (e.g. for compiled languages with non-standard layouts).
        traced_build: When True, forward ``--traced-build`` to the
            agent (traced-build CodeQL extraction for compiled
            languages). Default False adds no flag.

    Returns:
        List of absolute SARIF paths the agent wrote. Empty on any
        ordinary failure (logged). Raises ``SandboxSetupError`` when
        the agent reports the sandbox could not engage (fail-loud
        exit-3 contract), and re-raises ``KeyboardInterrupt`` /
        other non-``Exception`` aborts after killing the agent's
