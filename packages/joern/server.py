    The server listens on 127.0.0.1 with a random port.  Queries

    Sandbox note: the server process runs unsandboxed — same trust
    level as the LLM harness itself.  The CPG build step
    (``joern-parse``) that processes untrusted target code runs
    sandboxed via ``core.sandbox.run``.  The server only receives
    RAPTOR-authored CPGQL queries validated by ``_validate_query``,
    not raw target input.

    Cross-user isolation — ``POST /query-sync`` executes arbitrary
    Scala, so the endpoint must be unreachable for other local users.
    Two tiers, probed at boot (``_netns_isolation_available``):

    * Strong tier (unprivileged user namespaces work): the server
      boots inside a private network namespace behind
      ``netns_forwarder.py``. Its loopback TCP port does not exist on
      the host; the only way in is the forwarder's unix socket inside
      a 0700 directory, bound before the server can accept traffic.
      Every boot still generates a random HTTP Basic credential
      (``--server-auth-username`` / ``--server-auth-password``) and
      every client request carries the matching Authorization header.
      Honest caveat: that credential still travels on the server's
      argv and remains readable by ANY local user via
      ``/proc/<pid>/cmdline`` — but on this tier it gates nothing a
      cross-user attacker can reach (netns hides the port, directory
      permissions gate the socket), so it is defense-in-depth rather
      than a load-bearing secret. Same-uid processes can read it and
      connect through the socket; that is the intended trust boundary.
    * Fallback tier (no user namespaces): the server listens on
      host-loopback TCP and the argv credential is the ONLY thing
      keeping other local users out — and it is /proc-visible for the
      server's lifetime. ``start()`` logs a WARNING stating exactly
      that degradation, mirroring the sandbox's tier-degradation
      convention.

    If the installed joern does not support the auth flags,
    ``start()`` raises rather than exposing an unauthenticated
    server; callers fall back to the subprocess-per-query runner.
