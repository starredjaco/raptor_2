"""Semgrep runner — invoke semgrep, parse results, return structured output.

This module is intentionally minimal: build a command, run it, parse SARIF
and JSON output. Callers add their own concerns on top:

  - Sandbox POLICY. Execution is sandboxed BY DEFAULT: when no
    ``subprocess_runner`` is injected, run_rule() wraps the invocation in
    core.sandbox.run (Landlock scoped to the target, network blocked for
    local rule paths) and REFUSES to run when the sandbox is unavailable.
    Semgrep parses attacker-controlled source files, so parser bugs are a
    code-execution surface. Callers with their own sandbox pass
    ``subprocess_runner=`` (e.g. packages/static-analysis/scanner.py); the
    explicit escape hatch for trusted input is ``unsandboxed=True``.
  - HOME redirect into a per-run directory — scanner concern.
  - Output file layout (semgrep_<name>.sarif, .json, .stderr.log, .exit) —
    scanner persists; we hand back the raw strings.
  - Parallel orchestration across many configs — scanner uses
    ThreadPoolExecutor; we provide single-config run_rule() and a
    convenience run_rules() that runs sequentially.

# Why this exists: --x-ignore-semgrepignore-files (see build_cmd)
# disables not only the target's .semgrepignore files but ALSO
# semgrep's BUILT-IN default ignore set (which only applies when no
# .semgrepignore exists). This list restores the useful part of that
# default set from RAPTOR code, where a hostile target cannot edit it.
#
# Curation rule — dependency/build/artifact directories and generated
# files ONLY: names that by ecosystem convention hold third-party or
# machine-generated content nobody hand-edits. Deliberately ABSENT
# (diverging from semgrep's built-in defaults, probed on 1.172.0:
# .env/ .npm/ .tox/ .venv/ .yarn/ build/ dist/ node_modules/ test/
# tests/ vendor/):
#   - test/, tests/ — first-party code; skipping by NAME hands the
#     target a steerable hiding channel (mkdir tests/ && hide the bug;
#     demonstrated empirically on 1.172.0). Same reasoning keeps
#     examples/, docs/, scripts/ etc. out of this list.
#   - .env/ — the bare name collides with ``.env`` secret FILES;
#     excluding the pattern would blind secrets rules.
# Both-direction rationale: ADDING an entry re-opens a name-steerable
# hiding spot (any first-party-plausible name is a hole a target can
# mkdir its way into); REMOVING one buys back scan cost and finding
# noise on third-party code RAPTOR does not report on anyway.
