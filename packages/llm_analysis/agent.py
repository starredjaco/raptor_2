        Same trigger, same expanded starting context and same join
        contract as ``_expand_context_and_rerun`` — but instead of one
        blind wider re-ask, the model may spend up to
        ``MAX_TOOLLOOP_TURNS - 1`` turns REQUESTING specific context
        (``context_requests`` in the augmented schema: read_span /
        list_callers / list_callees, validated and served by
        ``packages.llm_analysis.context_toolloop``) before rendering
        its verdict; the final allowed turn uses the base schema, so
        the loop mechanically ends in a verdict. Each turn is one LLM
        call under its own transcript subject
        (``<finding_id>::toolloop::turn<N>`` — record/replay stays
        deterministic per turn).

        Budget is SHARED with the one-shot expansion: one triggered
        second look (loop or expansion) per slot, gated on the same
        attempt accounting (performed + errors across both features),
        so enabling the loop never raises the number of findings that
        get re-examined — only the per-finding call count, bounded by
        the turn cap.

        Returns the chosen analysis dict, or ``None`` when the first
        verdict stands untouched (cap reached / re-read failed / LLM
        call failed) — every such path is counted and annotated, never
        silent. Never raises. A stated confident verdict is never
        demoted: the join is ``join_verdicts`` unchanged.

          2. Otherwise: discover DBs lazily from `<out_dir>/codeql/`
