RAPTOR Orchestrator — Phase 4 of the /agentic workflow.

Dispatches structured findings from Phase 3 for parallel vulnerability
analysis, exploit generation, patch creation, consensus, and retry.

Dispatch routing:
  - External LLM configured: parallel generate_structured() / generate()
  - No external LLM + claude on PATH: claude -p sub-agents (via cc_dispatch)
  - Neither: return None (manual review)

If external LLM fails entirely, falls back to CC dispatch automatically.

      naming, runner tmp-dir hierarchy). Strip AFTER all internal
      consumers have used it (judge, consensus, aggregation) and

    * ``status`` is the QoL #19 canonical enum
      (``analysed`` / ``analysis_inconsistent`` / ``error`` /
      ``skipped_*``). Stamping it here lets on-disk readers
      (raptor_agentic summary, report renderers, future automation)

      invented; consumers that previously inferred from
      ``is_true_positive is None`` / ``self_contradictory`` /
      ``error`` keys now read ``status`` instead.

    Skipped variants (``skipped_over_budget``,
    ``skipped_duplicate``, etc.) are stamped by their respective
    producers (budget cap, dedup, binary-oracle) at skip time —
    this finaliser only handles the analysed / inconsistent /
    error cases that survive to the orchestrator emit.

    Extracted from the inline emit-time loop so it's unit-testable
    without driving the full orchestrate() dispatch path.

    Producer-stamped status (when a specific skip-reason or
    error-class producer set ``status`` explicitly upstream) is
    PRESERVED — derive's generic fallback would lose the

    Called from raptor_agentic.py Phase 4. Dispatches findings for parallel
    analysis, runs structural grouping, and optionally runs consensus and
    group analysis.

    Dispatch routing:
    - llm_config provided (external LLM) -> parallel generate_structured()
    - llm_config None + claude on PATH -> claude -p sub-agents
    - Neither -> return None

    If external LLM dispatch fails entirely, falls back to CC dispatch.

    Args:
        prep_report_path: Path to autonomous_analysis_report.json from Phase 3.
        repo_path: Target repository path.
        out_dir: Output directory for orchestration results.
        max_parallel: Maximum concurrent agents (0 = auto from model RPM).
        max_findings: Cap on findings dispatched — when > 0 and the
            report carries more, only the first max_findings are
            analysed. 0 (default) = no cap.
        no_exploits: Skip exploit generation.
        no_patches: Skip patch generation.
        llm_config: LLMConfig for external LLM dispatch (None = CC only).
        block_cc_dispatch: If True and dispatch falls to the CC path
            (no external LLM), abort and return None instead of
            spawning claude -p sub-agents. Set when the target repo
            contains credential helpers in .claude/settings.json.
        accept_weakened_defenses: If True, allow PASSTHROUGH fallback when
            the model fails the envelope probe. If False (default), abort
            orchestration with a clear error instead of silently weakening.
        dataflow_validation_enabled: If True (default), run the
            dataflow validation pass after analysis, reconcile its
            downgrades after consensus/judge, and record its metrics in
            the merged report. If False, all three steps are skipped.
        deep_validate: Passed through to the validation pass —
            force-enable Tier 2/3 LLM-backed predicate generation
            (operator's --deep-validate).
        deep_validate_disabled: Passed through to the validation pass —
            hard opt-out from Tier 2/3 (--no-deep-validate); takes
            precedence over deep_validate.
        deep_validate_budget: Budget threshold for the validation pass:
            fraction of the total budget above which validation is
            skipped. Default 0.60.
        allow_unreachable: Operator's --allow-unreachable; threaded
            into AnalysisTask so the Stage C reachability text in the
            analysis prompt switches from "engagement required" to
            "informational only".
        checklist: Optional checklist dict; passed to the source_intel
            and flow-context pre-seed steps for per-finding prompt
            context. None ⇒ pre-seeding runs without checklist context.
        rank_findings: If True, reorder findings most-promising-first
            (listwise LLM ranking) before the max_findings cap and the
            budgeted analysis loop, so caps cut the least promising
            tail. The stage itself only reorders — but note that when
            a cap then truncates, ordering decides what the cap cuts,
            which is why the ranking prompt envelope treats finding
            text as untrusted (see core/llm/ranking.py).

    Returns:
