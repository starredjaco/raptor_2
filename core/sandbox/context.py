      1. B fallback / cache hit set ``b_fallback_reason`` upstream
         (cmd[0] outside mount tree, or cached as known-failing).
         Their reason is the most specific: it names the binary.
      2. ``check_mount_available()`` False — host kernel refuses
         unprivileged mount-ns (Ubuntu 24.04 default sysctl).
      3. ``pass_fds=`` kwarg set (Linux only) — _spawn's fork chain
         doesn't plumb inherited fds; the call had to go
         subprocess+preexec. The macOS backend plumbs pass_fds
         natively, so this cause never applies on darwin.
      4. ``input=`` kwarg set (Linux only) — same reason; piping
         stdin via input= can't survive mount-ns fork+exec. Plumbed
         natively on darwin.
      5. ``target`` and ``output`` both None — mount-ns has nothing
         to bind-mount as the working area; the tracer has nowhere
         to attach in the new namespace.
      6. Catch-all — reachable only if a future change adds a new
         spawn-eligibility gate without updating this helper.

    Each branch returns a short ``reason`` (what failed) and
    ``instructions`` (operator action to fix). Both flow into the

    child — killing the sweeper before it can sweep, so a timed-out
    hostile target's descendants survived into the (weaker,
    marker-based) parent-side backstop. Here the deadline closes the
    per-run death pipe FIRST: the sweeper sees EOF, SIGKILLs the

      marker-based sweeps; the pid-namespace cascade is the real
      containment and every namespace-capable host uses it.
    * sweeper killability — on Landlock ABI < 6 there is no signal
      scoping, so a hostile target can SIGKILL the same-UID sweeper

    two callers in this module:

      * Per-spawn write inside ``_run()`` — fires after each
        sandboxed subprocess completes, capturing that spawn's
        proxy-event slice as soon as the spawn returns.
      * Block-level write inside ``sandbox()`` ``__exit__`` —
        captures events recorded against the block token (i.e.,
        from non-subprocess HTTPClient calls inside the with-
        block, such as ``agent.py`` running ``analyse()`` in-
        process). Caller pre-dedups against per-spawn events so a
        single ``proxy-events.jsonl`` doesn't carry duplicates of
        what the per-spawn writes already persisted.

    No-op when:
      * ``events`` is empty (no payload to write).
      * ``output`` is ``None`` (no persistence target configured).
      * ``output`` resolves inside ``target`` (target-pollution
        skip — some callers pass ``output=target`` for writable
        Landlock surface; persisting the JSONL there would
        pollute the scanned tree).

    Non-fatal on every write failure. Observability is nice-to-

    missing audit data can find the cause.

    SECURITY-SENSITIVE: this predicate is the ONLY socket shape the
    pass_fds gate admits, and it is deliberately capability-equivalent
    to the stdio pipes the gate already allows — a private byte stream
    to the trusted calling process, nothing else. Every check below is
    load-bearing:

    * ``AF_UNIX`` + ``SOCK_STREAM`` — no INET/DGRAM shapes; an
      inherited INET socket is a network capability the seccomp
      socket-family filter never sees.
    * both endpoint addresses UNNAMED (empty) — a pathname or
      abstract address on EITHER end means the fd reaches (or can be
      reached by) something addressable in a shared namespace, e.g. a
      connected ``/var/run/docker.sock`` client, which this gate
      exists to refuse. ``getpeername`` must also succeed: an
      unconnected socket is a listener-shaped capability, not a pipe.
    * ``SO_PEERCRED`` peer pid == ``os.getpid()`` — the OTHER half is
      held by the calling process itself, i.e. THIS process created
      the pair via ``socketpair(2)``. A pair minted by a foreign
      process and smuggled in over SCM_RIGHTS reports the foreign
      pid and refuses. Platforms without ``SO_PEERCRED`` (non-Linux)
      refuse — fail closed; the pathname transport is primary there.

    The fd is inspected through a dup-wrapped ``socket.socket`` so
    the caller's descriptor keeps its state (no ownership transfer).
    Returns ``None`` when the fd qualifies, else the refusal reason.

    """Context manager for sandboxed subprocess execution.

    Each run() call inside the context runs the target command with the
    isolation configured here. When `block_network=True`, mount
    isolation, or a read restriction is active, each run() launches its
    command through the fork-based spawn backend inside fresh user/pid/
    ipc/cgroup(+net) namespaces (with the pivot_root bind tree when
    target/output engage it, mountlessly otherwise); Landlock-only runs
    do NOT use namespaces and execute in the calling process's
    namespace (Landlock is applied in the child via preexec_fn).
    Resource rlimits always apply.

    Args:
        block_network: If True, block all network access via a fresh
                      network namespace. Overridden by profile=
                      and by --sandbox/--no-sandbox CLI flags.
        target: Path to target repo. Engages Landlock. Under Landlock, the
               path is an engagement marker only (Landlock does not restrict
               reads); under mount-namespace mode, it is bind-mounted read-
               only at its original absolute path inside the namespace.
        output: Path to output dir (always writable inside the sandbox).
               Engages Landlock and — when mount is active — bind-mounted
               writable at its original absolute path.
        map_root: Map current UID to root inside namespace (needed by some
                 builds that check `getuid() == 0`).
        limits: Resource limit overrides (memory_mb, max_file_mb, cpu_seconds).
        allowed_tcp_ports: If set, Landlock restricts TCP connect() to these
                          ports only (e.g. [443] for HTTPS API access).
                          Requires ABI v4 (kernel 6.7+); earlier kernels
                          emit a WARNING. Engages Landlock.

                          Landlock's network rule covers ONLY TCP connect().
                          UDP, raw sockets, and inbound TCP are NOT
                          restricted by this parameter — set
                          `block_network=True` for a hard network-off
                          policy (but then allowed_tcp_ports is useless
                          because the namespace removes all interfaces;
                          mixing the two produces a warning).
        profile: Named profile ('full', 'strict', 'target_run',
                'debug', 'frida', 'network-only', 'none' — the
                profiles.PROFILES table). Forces
                block_network to the profile's value AND — when the profile
                disables Landlock — nulls `target`, `output`, and
                `allowed_tcp_ports` (with a WARNING log if any were set).
                Unknown profile strings raise ValueError. Use --sandbox
                <profile> on the command line.
        disabled: Shortcut for `profile='none'`. All isolation off; only
                 rlimits apply. Kept as a separate param because its call
                 sites in code are easier to audit than an opaque profile
                 string.
        use_egress_proxy: If True, route the child's outbound HTTPS
                 traffic through a local HTTPS-CONNECT proxy with a
                 hostname allowlist. Enforcement is tiered (strongest
                 available wins): with netns capability the child runs
                 in an EMPTY network namespace (loopback up) and
                 reaches the proxy only via a unix-socket bridge —
                 DNS/UDP exfil is impossible topologically and no
                 seccomp UDP block is needed, so loopback-UDP tools
                 (gradle) work. Without netns, Landlock pins TCP
                 connect to the proxy port and seccomp blocks
                 AF_INET/AF_INET6 SOCK_DGRAM to close the DNS/UDP
                 exfil channel (gradle-class UDP-at-startup tools
                 break there). The child env is extended with
                 HTTPS_PROXY/http_proxy (both cases, for Node/curl/
                 Python AND CodeQL's Java stack). Pair with
                 `proxy_hosts=[...]` to declare the hostname
                 allowlist.
        proxy_allowed_ports: Destination-port allowlist for this
                 context's proxy lane (gate 1b, always enforcing).
                 None = any port (legacy behaviour). The networked
                 untrusted helper passes [443] to make its docstring
                 contract real — hostname authorisation alone would
                 let the child CONNECT to any 1-65535 service on an
                 allowlisted host.
        proxy_hosts: Hostname allowlist for the egress proxy. Union'd
                 with any existing allowlist if the proxy singleton is
                 already running. Required when use_egress_proxy=True.
        loopback_unix_bridges: Mapping of {port: unix_socket_path}
                 relayed inside the child's empty network namespace:
                 the child connects to 127.0.0.1:<port> and the
                 pre-Landlock relay forwards the bytes to the named
                 unix socket on the host. Requires
                 use_egress_proxy=True (ValueError) AND the netns
                 egress tier (SandboxSetupError when only the
                 Landlock/advisory tiers are available). When set, the
                 staged proxy env carries NO_PROXY=127.0.0.1,localhost
                 so bridged loopback traffic goes direct instead of
                 dying at the CONNECT proxy's loopback rejection.
        require_proxy_netns: Fail-closed switch for the egress tiers
                 (Linux only; inert on macOS): when True and
                 use_egress_proxy cannot engage the netns tier, raise
                 SandboxSetupError instead of degrading to the
                 port-scoped Landlock pin — which does not enforce the
                 hostname allowlist. RAPTOR_ALLOW_DEGRADED_UNTRUSTED=1
                 is the operator override that accepts the weaker tier.
        restrict_reads: If True, flip Landlock's default "read everywhere"
                 to "read only in allowed paths". Defaults to a system-
                 dirs allowlist that covers what normal compiled binaries
                 need (libc, ld.so, /proc, /dev, target, output, /tmp)
                 but excludes $HOME — so a sandboxed attacker binary
                 can't read ~/.ssh, ~/.aws/credentials, ~/.config/raptor/
                 models.json. Extend with `readable_paths=[...]` if the
                 tool needs more.
        readable_paths: Extra read-allowed paths (adds to the default
                 system-dirs list when restrict_reads=True). Ignored
                 when restrict_reads=False (reads are already wide).
        tool_paths: Extra read-allowed directories for the TOOLCHAIN
                 being run — unioned with readable_paths into the
                 Landlock read allowlist and the mount-ns read-only
                 bind set, so a tool installed outside the system dirs
                 is visible and executable inside the sandbox. PATH
                 entries under a declared dir also survive the child
                 env's home-scrub (home-rooted PATH entries are
                 otherwise dropped), so a $HOME-resident toolchain
                 declared here resolves by name. A multi-dir toolchain
                 needs EVERY dir it execs through declared — rustup's
                 ~/.cargo/bin proxies re-exec ~/.rustup/toolchains/*,
                 so both dirs belong in the list.
                 Extended by the --sandbox-tool-path CLI flag. Callers
                 spawning user-local toolchains under strict/
                 restrict_reads need this (see
                 python_runtime_tool_paths()).
        writable_paths: Extra write-allowed paths (absolutized),
                 layered on top of the canonical writable surface
                 (output + the /tmp baseline). Use case: resolver
                 scratch dirs (~/.cache/pip, ~/.npm, ~/.m2) that live
                 outside the per-run output dir.
        exclude_tmp_baseline: If True, drop /tmp (and /dev/shm) from
                 the writable baseline so the child cannot write
                 ANYWHERE under /tmp (exploit-engine wrapper-script
                 defence). Only use when the sandboxed program is
                 known not to need /tmp to start — a normal python3
                 import writes pyc cache there.
        caller_label: Optional short identifier (e.g. "claude-sub-agent",
                 "codeql-pack-download") that propagates into proxy
                 event records. Used for per-caller filtering of
                 sandbox_info["proxy_events"] when multiple callers
                 share the proxy singleton.
        fake_home: If True, the child's HOME and XDG_*_HOME env vars
                 are overridden to point at `{output}/.home/` — an
                 empty directory created for this sandbox. Tools see a
                 fresh, credential-free home: `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws/...`,
                 `~/.config/gh/...` etc. are absent (not just EACCES
                 via Landlock — they don't exist). Complements
                 `restrict_reads=True` by converting the HOME-denial
                 from "Landlock blocks reads" into "there's nothing
                 there to read". Callers that need specific files
                 available in the fake HOME (e.g. an API-key config)
                 should pre-populate `{output}/.home/` before invoking.
                 Requires `output=` to be set. Defaults to True on
                 `run_untrusted()`, False on direct `sandbox()` use.
        audit: If True, engage the audit evidence channel for this
                 context's run() calls: a spawn-tier syscall tracer
                 records JSONL evidence under `<dir>/.audit` of the
                 audit target dir (audit_run_dir or output). Per-call
                 equivalent of the --audit CLI flag; silently no-ops
                 when the sandbox is effectively disabled.
        audit_verbose: Trace every syscall, not just those outside the
                 enforcement allowlist. Only takes effect when audit
                 mode is engaged; forced on by observe=True.
        audit_run_dir: Directory the audit tiers write evidence into
                 (they create only the `.audit/` subdir — the dir
                 itself must already exist and be writable, else
                 ValueError). Decouples "where audit JSONL goes" from
                 Landlock's output= restriction: pass it alone for
                 audit signal without a writable-path restriction.
                 When unset, audit falls back to output; audit mode
                 requires one of the two.
        observe: Observe mode — implies audit and audit_verbose,
                 writes to a separate observe JSONL, extends the trace
                 set with the stat family, and stamps a per-run
                 128-bit nonce into
                 result.sandbox_info["observe_nonce"] for
                 spoof-resistant parse_observe_log() parsing.
        audit_required: (default False) Fail-closed switch for the audit
                 evidence channel (precedent: `require_sanitisation`).
                 When True and audit mode is engaged for a run() call but
                 NO audit tier can attach (mount-ns/seatbelt spawn tracer
                 AND the Landlock-only tracer both unavailable or failed),
                 raise SandboxSetupError instead of degrading to an
                 unaudited subprocess — the command does not execute.
                 When False (default), degradation is permitted but is
                 always recorded: the per-run
                 ``sandbox-audit-degraded.json`` marker is written and
                 ``result.sandbox_info["audit_engaged"]`` is False. Inert
                 when audit mode is not engaged for the call.
        degraded_net_deny: (default True) When `block_network=True` was
                 requested but no namespace backend is available on this
                 host (Landlock-only degradation — Ubuntu 24.04+ AppArmor
                 userns default, SELinux, nested containers), fall back
                 to Landlock's TCP-connect deny (ABI v4+): every outbound
                 TCP connect fails with EACCES instead of silently running
                 with full host network. Loopback connects are denied too
                 (Landlock net rules are port-scoped, not address-scoped),
                 which breaks daemon-IPC tools; known offenders are nudged
                 to no-daemon mode via env (GRADLE_OPTS, NX_DAEMON). bind/
                 listen are untouched; seccomp denies IPv4/IPv6 UDP
                 socket creation, including DNS. This fallback refuses
                 to run without a working seccomp filter. When the TCP deny
                 cannot engage either (no Landlock ABI v4+ — which also
                 leaves an allowed_tcp_ports allowlist unenforceable on
                 this path), the context raises SandboxSetupError
                 rather than running with the demanded block silently
                 absent. On Linux with the default True, block_network=
                 True therefore always yields a deny layer, an enforced
                 port allowlist, or a refusal — never silently open
                 egress; the explicit acceptance levers are False here
                 (per call: a workload that genuinely needs loopback
                 TCP / egress on a degraded host) and
                 RAPTOR_ALLOW_DEGRADED_UNTRUSTED=1 (host-wide, converts
                 the refusal to a loud warning). No effect when a
                 namespace backend is available or on macOS (whose
                 seatbelt lane has its own posture).
        omit_proc_reads: (default False) Remove `/proc` from the
                 default read allowlist computed under
                 `restrict_reads=True`. Set by `run_untrusted()` /
                 `run_untrusted_networked()` on hosts where the PID
                 namespace cannot engage (no unprivileged userns) and
                 the operator overrode the fail-closed refusal via
                 RAPTOR_ALLOW_DEGRADED_UNTRUSTED: without a pid-ns, a
                 compromised child in the HOST pid namespace can read
                 `/proc/<pid>/environ` of any same-UID process — the
                 credential-exfil channel the untrusted contract
                 exists to close. Cost: tools that read `/proc/self/*`
                 (ASAN, IFUNC dispatch, runtime CPU detection) fail
                 with EACCES; extend `readable_paths=` for specific
                 needs. Inert when `restrict_reads` is off (no read
                 allowlist exists).
        omit_etc_reads: (default False) Swap the wholesale `/etc` grant
                 in the `restrict_reads=True` read allowlist for the
                 minimal per-file set the loader and TLS stacks need
                 (`_ETC_MINIMAL_READS`: ld.so cache/conf, alternatives,
                 CA material, localtime). For callers whose payload has
                 no business enumerating host identity files
                 (`/etc/passwd`, `/etc/hosts`, `/etc/machine-id`, ...)
                 this holds on the Landlock-only tier too, where no
                 private mount view exists. Cost: anything else under
                 /etc reads as EACCES — extend `readable_paths=` for
                 specific needs. Inert when `restrict_reads` is off.
        sanitise_host_fingerprint: If True, build a host-fingerprint
                 persona once per context (synthetic cpuinfo etc.
                 bind-mounted over the real files, plus UTS/identity
                 and CPU-affinity changes) so the child sees a
                 sanitised host identity. Requires Linux, the mount-ns
                 backend, and at least one of target=/output=; when
                 any is missing it degrades to a one-shot WARNING (the
                 identity surfaces stay host-real) unless
                 require_sanitisation=True.
        cpu_count: CPU count the fingerprint persona claims (its
                 cpuinfo), default 4; set_cpu_affinity clamps to the
                 host's actual CPUs at apply time. Ignored with a
                 warning when sanitise_host_fingerprint=False.
        require_sanitisation: Fail-closed switch for the persona: when
                 True and sanitisation cannot engage (unsupported
                 platform, no mount-ns, no target/output), raise
                 RuntimeError instead of logging the degradation
                 warning. Also binds PER-RUN coverage: a per-overlay
                 bind failure or missing target inside the mount-ns
                 child aborts setup (instead of skip-and-continue),
                 and a mount-ns setup/exec failure raises
                 SandboxSetupError instead of degrading to the
                 Landlock-only fallback (which cannot apply the
                 persona at all).
        etc_overlay: Dict mapping in-sandbox /etc paths (e.g.
                 "/etc/sudoers") to host source files bind-mounted
                 over them during mount-ns init (mount-ns backend
                 only; non-str or missing-source entries are skipped
                 with a warning). Keys are also appended to the read
                 allowlist under restrict_reads=True.
        rootfs: Directory holding an unpacked container-image filesystem
                 (e.g. `docker create` + `docker export`). When set, the
                 mount namespace pivots into THAT tree instead of the
                 tmpfs-of-host-system-dirs — the command runs against
                 the image's own /usr, /lib, /etc with per-namespace
                 /dev, /proc, /sys, /tmp, /run on top, ns-local pids
                 (an in-process PID-1 waiter reaps and mirrors exit
                 status), and a subuid/subgid RANGE map so image
                 entrypoints can chown/setuid to non-root uids.
                 FAIL-CLOSED: rootfs requires the Linux mount-ns spawn
                 backend — every degradation that other calls tolerate
                 (Landlock-only fallback, seatbelt, profile 'none',
                 pass_fds/input kwargs) raises SandboxSetupError
                 instead, because "degraded" here means the command
                 would run against the HOST filesystem while the caller
                 believes it is containerised. The rootfs directory is
                 the sacrificial writable upper layer: the environment
                 writes into it host-side; treat it as consumed after
                 the run. target/output binds, readable_paths,
                 audit/observe, and network policy compose unchanged.
        output_run_root_ok: Acknowledge that `output=` deliberately
                 names a run-directory ROOT (a directory carrying
                 `.raptor-run.json`). The run root is parent-attributed
                 state the parent re-reads after the child exits —
                 findings, manifests, the run's own recorded outcome —
                 so granting a sandboxed child write access to it is a
                 seam worth flagging. Default False: a run-root
                 `output=` logs a once-per-(process,path) warning.
                 Trusted-agent lanes whose contract IS "write this
                 run's artifacts" pass True; hostile lanes should pass
                 a work subdirectory instead
                 (core.sandbox.work_dir.hostile_work_subdir).
                 Detection only — never a refusal, and never consulted
                 when the sandbox is effectively disabled.

    Landlock activation: engaged when any of `target`, `output`, or
    `allowed_tcp_ports` is set. Default filesystem policy is read-
    everywhere, write-nowhere-except-`/tmp`-and-`output`. `target` and
    `output` are independent — you can pass either, both, or neither.

    Profiles:
        full:         network blocked + Landlock + seccomp + rlimits (default)
        strict:       full + fail-closed backend checks + restrict_reads
                      defaulted True (and fake_home when output= is set).
                      Explicit restrict_reads=/fake_home= kwargs override
                      the profile defaults. Callers spawning user-local
                      toolchains (pip --user, pyenv, ~/venv) under strict
                      must pass tool_paths=[...] (see
                      python_runtime_tool_paths()).
        debug:        full, but seccomp permits ptrace (for gdb/rr use cases
                      under /crash-analysis). All other seccomp blocks remain.
        target_run:   full's layers with the network OPEN (block_network
                      False) — for targets that must reach the network
                      under otherwise-full confinement.
        frida:        network open + Landlock + the frida seccomp profile
                      (AF_UNIX allowed for frida-helper IPC; memfd exec
                      carve-out). Consented instrumentation lane.
        network-only: network blocked + rlimits only (no Landlock, no seccomp)
        none:         rlimits only, no isolation

    (Complete member list, kept in sync with profiles.PROFILES — the
    operator-facing help in cli.py derives from the same table.)

        # Tier 1 — netns bridge (any Landlock ABI; needs the SPAWN
        # backend): the child runs in an EMPTY netns (loopback
        # brought up by the spawn layer) and reaches the proxy only
        # through the forwarder that relays loopback TCP → unix
        # socket. Containment is topological: no interfaces, no
        # routes out, so DNS/UDP exfil is impossible WITHOUT the
        # seccomp UDP block — which means JVM tools that open a
        # loopback UDP socket before any build (gradle's
        # FileLockContentionHandler / local-IP detection) work here.
        # Previously this tier engaged only on ABI < 4 hosts; it is
        # strictly stronger than the Landlock pin (port-scoped to ANY
        # host) on every host, so it is the default whenever it can
        # actually engage.

        # is only used when the mount-ns tier is live (use_mount —
        # see the backend selection below and `spawn_eligible`). On a
        # host with netns but WITHOUT the spawn backend (no uidmap
        # helpers, LSM-restricted unprivileged userns → the CLI
        # `unshare` fallback path), choosing this tier used to hand
        # the child an empty netns with NO forwarder: the proxy was
        # unreachable, every use_egress_proxy child silently lost all
        # network, and the proxy's audit stream recorded nothing.
        # Mirror use_mount's condition here so such hosts take Tier 2
        # — the tier the design assigns to "no netns" hosts, and the
        # tier they took before the netns default — keeping the
        # chokepoint reachable and its event telemetry live.

            _LANE_TIERS registry (KeyError on an unregistered lane
            fails closed), the hard pre-exec assertion runs, and only
            then is ``executor`` invoked. Structural guarantee: the
            AST gate in the contract tests forbids bare
            process-spawning calls in this module outside this
            chokepoint (and the named executor helpers it invokes), so
            a future lane cannot ship an unchecked executor — the
            check is not a convention beside the spawn, it IS the
            spawn's entry point. ``cap`` lowers the declared tier for
            per-call posture reductions (skip_pid_ns keeps the host
            procfs on both spawn lanes; a Landlock-less kernel or the
            operator disable reduces the plain-subprocess lane to
            rlimits-only). ``cause`` chains the original backend
            failure that demoted the call here.

            When the floor holds only because the operator's waiver
            lowered it (floor source "env") and the lane leaves the
            host process table visible, the consented-degrade warning
            fires on EVERY such call — each one runs attacker-derived
            code under a reduced contract, and an operator watching a

    a floor: an explicit surface names a tier whose contract includes

    ``record_dir`` — the caller's evidence-attribution dir
    (``audit_run_dir or output``, threaded by run_untrusted*): every
    refusal this gate raises is floor-class in substance (the
    environment cannot meet the untrusted containment contract — the
    target never executed), so each one records a ``floor_refusal``
    into the run-dir evidence stream via
    :func:`_record_floor_refusal` before propagating, exactly like
    the refusals raised inside run(). Arm-by-arm typed mapping
    (achievable understates, never overstates):

    * darwin seatbelt arm — floor=the resolved untrusted floor
      (SEATBELT), achievable=BARE (rlimits-only is all a
      seatbelt-less mac delivers);
    * libseccomp arm — floor=the resolved untrusted floor,
      achievable=BARE (every tier's contract includes the filter, so
      no tier is fully deliverable without it — the same mapping as
      run()'s seccomp axis arm);
    * userns arm — floor=the resolved untrusted floor,
      achievable=LANDLOCK_ONLY when Landlock is available (the
      policy layers still engage), else BARE.

    The contract's credential-exfil defence is the PID/user namespace:
    without it the child runs as caller_uid in the HOST namespaces,
    where /proc/<host_pid>/environ of same-UID processes is readable
    (restrict_reads grants /proc wholesale — see the rationale at the
    effective_read_paths block). On hosts without unprivileged userns
    the namespace tier silently never engaged, so "untrusted" ran with
    the exact exposure the helper exists to prevent.

    Default: refuse loudly. RAPTOR_ALLOW_DEGRADED_UNTRUSTED=1 is the
    explicit operator acknowledgement that Landlock/seccomp-only
    containment is acceptable on this host. macOS is exempt from the
    NAMESPACE requirement because the seatbelt tier provides the
    isolation contract there — but only when seatbelt actually
    engages: a missing/smoke-failing sandbox-exec would otherwise let
    the default (non-strict) profile degrade to a bare subprocess
    with a warn_once, silently violating the fail-closed contract the
    Linux arm enforces. The darwin arm therefore requires
    check_seatbelt_available() or the same explicit operator
    override.

    Returns True when the override engaged degraded mode AND the read
    allowlist is in force — callers then pass omit_proc_reads=True so
    the whole-of-/proc grant (and with it the same-UID environ
    credential channel) is withdrawn for that call. The override
    warning fires on EVERY degraded call (deliberately not warn_once):
    each such call runs ATTACKER-DERIVED code with a reduced contract,
    and an operator watching a long run must see every instance, not
    just the first. With restrict_reads=False there is no read
    allowlist to withdraw /proc from, so the warning names the open
    exposure instead and False is returned.

    the caller must close once the dispatched run returns.

    The stdin/setsid defences plug fd 0 and /dev/tty, but when the
    caller doesn't capture, the child inherits the operator's fd 1/2
    with whatever access mode the PARENT opened them — and read rights
    ride the descriptor past every path-based layer. Two readable
    shapes exist:

    * a PTY slave is opened O_RDWR, which setsid() does NOT revoke —
      a target that read()s its OWN stdout/stderr taps the operator's
      keystrokes;
    * a non-tty O_RDWR descriptor (regular file opened rw, a socket,
      an rw FIFO) hands the child read access to content the sandbox
      policy never granted.

    Hand the child a WRITE-ONLY reopen instead (output identical;
    reads fail EBADF). ttys reopen via ttyname; other reopenable
    objects (regular files, FIFOs) via the fd's /proc//dev magic link
    with the original O_APPEND preserved. Sockets have no write-only
    reopen — plug with DEVNULL and tell the operator to capture
    instead (discarding output is strictly safer than granting a read
    channel to the operator's socket peer). Write-only pass-throughs
    (the normal shell-redirect shape) are untouched.

    One shared function, not per-entry copies: the guard first landed
    inline in ``run_untrusted`` only, and the networked sibling
    shipped without it — an untrusted networked child could read the
    operator's keystrokes off its own stdout while every other
    defence held. Any future untrusted entry point calls this helper

    Always engages the full sandbox: network blocked by namespace, Landlock
    filesystem restriction (via `target`/`output`), resource rlimits. At
    least one of `target` or `output` must be truthy so Landlock actually
    engages — empty strings are rejected.

    Network block cannot be disabled here. `allowed_tcp_ports` is
    intentionally not accepted: this function forces `block_network=True`
    at the namespace level, which removes all network interfaces inside
    the sandbox — so any Landlock TCP allow-rule would be inert. Callers
    wanting a network allowlist (e.g. Claude sub-agents on port 443) must
    use `sandbox()` directly with `block_network=False` and their own
    `allowed_tcp_ports=[...]`.

    `restrict_reads` defaults to True for run_untrusted() — the premise
    is "we're running attacker-derived code, protect the invoking user's
    credentials". With restrict_reads=True, reads are limited to system
    dirs (/usr, /lib, /etc, /proc, /sys), target, output, /tmp, and
    specific safe /dev files (null/zero/random/urandom/full/tty).
    Critically, $HOME is NOT readable — so a compromised PoC cannot
    exfiltrate ~/.ssh, ~/.aws/credentials, ~/.config/raptor/models.json,
    etc. If a specific tool needs more, pass readable_paths=[...] to
    extend, or pass restrict_reads=False to opt back into the old
    read-everywhere behaviour (please don't unless absolutely necessary
    — credential exfil is the primary attack surface here).

    `fake_home` also defaults to True: the child's HOME and XDG_*_HOME
    point at `{output}/.home/` (an empty per-sandbox directory) so the
    child sees a clean home containing no dotfiles. Complements
    restrict_reads by converting HOME-denial from "Landlock blocks the
    read" into "the file isn't there to be read" — tools that
    hard-fail on EACCES now get ENOENT (or an empty home) and fall
    back to defaults. Pre-populate `{output}/.home/` before calling
    run_untrusted() if the child needs specific files in its home.

    For compiling/running LLM-generated code, running target binaries,
    invoking target build scripts, or anything else where the command or
    its inputs trace back to untrusted material.

    The trust markers (``CLAUDECODE`` / ``_RAPTOR_TRUSTED``) are
    stripped from the child environment so a target-spawned process
    cannot invoke RAPTOR's ``libexec/`` scripts as a "trusted caller"
    — it hits their refusal path instead. ``RAPTOR_DIR`` is stripped
    on the same contract: the libexec trust gate does not accept it
    and an untrusted target has no legitimate use for the checkout
    path.

    `**kwargs` forwards to run() — composable with audit/audit_verbose
    (audit-mode applies to the run_untrusted's full-strict profile),
    caller_label=, env=, cwd=, etc. `profile=` is accepted as a RATCHET
    only: 'full' (the default) or 'strict' (fail-closed — aborts with
    SandboxSetupError instead of degrading when an isolation layer is
    unavailable; see PROFILES). Weaker profiles are rejected via
    TypeError because they would relax the untrusted-execution contract
    this helper exists to enforce. Also forbidden via TypeError:
    `block_network` and `allowed_tcp_ports` — run_untrusted's contract
    is namespace-level network block, no TCP allowlist — and
    `start_new_session` — setsid is part of the same contract (no
    controlling tty, so /dev/tty cannot read the operator's
    keystrokes); callers needing varied network/session policy use
    sandbox() directly.

    """Variant of :func:`run_untrusted` that allows hostname-allowlisted
    HTTPS egress instead of full network block.

    Use case: an LLM-driven sub-agent or tool that must reach a known
    upstream API (e.g. ``api.anthropic.com``) but is otherwise treated
    as adversarial — Claude Code dispatches, future LLM-callers that
    need network. ``run_untrusted()``'s namespace-level network block
    makes those calls impossible; ad-hoc :func:`sandbox()` callers
    forget to set ``restrict_reads=True`` and lose credential isolation
    on Landlock-only hosts (Ubuntu 24.04+ default — see
    ``core/security/THREAT_MODEL.md`` I2-(a)).

    This helper enforces the safe defaults for that case:

      * ``restrict_reads=True`` — kernel-level read allowlist; $HOME
        is denied. Callers that need extra paths pass
        ``readable_paths=[...]``.
      * ``fake_home=False`` — Claude Code reads ``~/.claude.json`` and
        is incompatible with HOME-redirection; callers with no such
        constraint can override.
      * ``use_egress_proxy=True`` + ``proxy_hosts=[...]`` — egress
        proxy with hostname allowlist (the only network this child can
        reach is the listed hosts on port 443).
      * ``allowed_tcp_ports=[443]`` — only HTTPS to the proxy.
      * ``proxy_allowed_ports=[443]`` — the proxy's own lane refuses
        CONNECTs to any other destination port, making the
        hosts-on-443 contract real at the enforcement point.
      * ``block_network=False`` — must be False so the proxy is
        reachable from inside the sandbox.

    Mirrors :func:`run_untrusted`'s stdin / start_new_session
    defaults — DEVNULL stdin, setsid — and its trust-marker hygiene
    (``CLAUDECODE`` / ``_RAPTOR_TRUSTED`` stripped from the child
    env) for the same reasons.

    ``keep_trust_markers=True`` opts OUT of that strip for RAPTOR's
    own Claude Code skill dispatches (``core.orchestration.
    skill_dispatch``): the spawned CLI is RAPTOR's trusted binary
    operating on the same operator-approved run — its whole job is to
    drive ``libexec/`` helpers whose preamble refuses callers without
    a marker — and the dispatch is already gated by cc-trust and the
    rule-of-two before it reaches this helper. The markers only pass
    through when the PARENT actually holds them (an untrusted parent
    has nothing to propagate). NEVER set this for commands derived
    from target-repo content; ``run_untrusted`` deliberately has no
    such opt-out.

    ``loopback_unix_bridges`` — mapping of ``{port: unix_socket_path}``
    relayed INSIDE the child's empty network namespace: the child
    reaches ``127.0.0.1:<port>`` and the pre-Landlock relay forwards
    the bytes to the named Unix socket on the host (same mechanism as
    the egress-proxy bridge). Used by credential-proxy CLI children to
    reach the LLM dispatcher without holding provider credentials.
    Netns-tier only: on hosts where the netns tier cannot engage the
    sandbox raises ``SandboxSetupError`` rather than running the child
    without its bridged service (fail closed). When set, the sandbox's
    proxy env carries ``NO_PROXY=127.0.0.1,localhost`` so bridged
    loopback traffic goes direct instead of dying at the CONNECT
    proxy's loopback rejection.

    Callers: Claude Code sub-agent dispatch (packages/llm_analysis/
    cc_dispatch.py, core/orchestration/agentic_passes.py,
    core/audit/validate.py), git network operations
    (core/git/clone.py), the BigQuery query child
    (libexec/raptor-bq-query → core/forensics/bq_query.py), and other
    hostname-allowlisted egress consumers; see THREAT_MODEL.md.
