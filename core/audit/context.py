# Lines of context before AND after a matched call line in the

# consumers that bound snippet height (the /agentic caller channel

# the call line itself — an argument built on the line above
# (`len = strlen(src);` then `copy(dst, src, len)`) is invisible, so
# the reviewer cannot see whether the caller validated what it
# passes. Too large: the snippet cost multiplies by the number of

# no call_site attached (the reviewer sees the caller's name but not

    every remaining non-printable becomes a visible ``\xHH``/
    ``\uHHHH`` escape, backticks become ``\x60``, and the length is
    bounded. Purely a RENDER-time transform — ctx fields keep their
    original values for lookups.

    Printable identifiers stay byte-faithful (escaping, never
    rejection: an identifier must remain renderable and recognisable
    in the prompt). Two hostile classes get escaped rather than
    passed through:

    - **Non-printables beyond C0/DEL** (the log-sanitisation
      contract's classifier): bidi overrides/embeddings/isolates
      enable visual-reorder deception in rendered prompts and
      reports, zero-width characters enable homoglyph-adjacent
      spoofing, and C1 controls are terminal-live. All of Unicode
      Cc/Cf/Cn/Co/Cs/Zl/Zp escapes to the contract's literal form.
    - **Backticks**: most call sites wrap the returned identifier in
      a single-backtick code span; a backtick INSIDE the identifier
      closes that span early and the identifier's remainder renders
      as live prompt prose (instruction/heading forgery without any
      newline). Escaping at the shared helper keeps every wrapping
      site's span intact; no legitimate identifier grammar needs a
      live backtick.

    Known limitations (documented by design, not gaps this helper
    closes):

    - Escaping is NOT injective — an attacker writing the literal
      text ``\x60`` produces the same rendered bytes as a real
      escaped backtick. The security property (nothing live) holds
      either way; forensic consumers needing byte fidelity read the
      ctx fields, never the rendered prompt. A model that decodes
      and re-quotes an escape when regenerating text is a
      second-order consumer concern, same as for the log contract.
    - Homoglyph/fullwidth respellings of tag vocabulary (e.g.
      fullwidth brackets) pass byte-faithful: printable, semantic
      layer — ownership documented at ``_ENVELOPE_TAG_RE``'s
      spelling note (a confusable fold belongs in the character
      layer there, one home for all arms).
    - The ``...[truncated]`` marker is plain text an attacker can
      also write — cosmetic; truncation grants nothing.
