"""Joern no-execution verification channels for /audit hypotheses.

Two mechanical verifiers on the live Joern CPG server:

* **Guard-dominance** — for "missing check" hypotheses (missing
  bounds / null / auth check on identifier X before sink Y).  A CPGQL
  query determines whether a control-structure condition mentioning X
  DOMINATES the claimed sink call site (every path from function entry
  to the sink evaluates the check).  A dominating check mechanically
  REFUTES the "missing check" hypothesis, with the dominator node as
  evidence.  No dominating check is confirm-capable only when the sink
  and identifier both match the hypothesis (identifier-consistency
  negative control, same discipline as sweep.py's semgrep controls).

* **Flow reachability** — for taint-style hypotheses ("attacker data
  from X reaches Y").  A ``reachableByFlows`` query from the named
  source to the named sink within the function (or across the file).
  A flow with matching identifiers confirms with the flow path as
  evidence; no flow on a well-formed query refutes only when the CPG
  actually covered the function — if the function is not in the CPG
  the outcome is inconclusive, never refuted (vacuity guard).

Security posture matches ``packages/joern``: the scanned repo is
untrusted and nothing from it executes.  Queries are RAPTOR-authored
CPGQL with every substituted value validated against the identifier
allowlist and Scala-escaped; results come back over the loopback-only
server API.  When Joern is unavailable the outcome is ``error`` with a
clear reason — never a crash, never a fabricated verdict.

Returns :class:`core.audit.sweep.SweepResult`-compatible outcomes.
Evidence stamps are namespaced ``joern:guard-dominance`` /
``joern:flow``.
