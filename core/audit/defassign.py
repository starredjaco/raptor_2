"""Definite-assignment prover for uninitialised-value claims on C code.

Refutes an uninitialised-return / uninitialised-use claim on a C
function by proving, mechanically, that the variable the claim names
is assigned on every path from its declaration to every use in the
function.  The refuting fact is a dataflow tautology over the
macro-expanded source — mechanically true however the claim's prose is
read — which is what qualifies it for proof grade in the refutation
lattice (consumers wire it into ``_PROOF_GATES``; this module only
computes the fact).

Mechanism
---------

1.  **Macro expansion from the target tree's own headers.**  The
    anchor file's ``#include`` closure is resolved inside the target
    tree (the file's directory, ``<target>/include``, then the target
    root) and scanned for ``#define``/``#undef``.  Macro invocations in
    the function source are then expanded with that table:

    - a macro whose full expansion is *statement-shaped* (kernel
      iteration macros such as ``list_for_each_entry``) is spliced in
      one level at a time so its control structure joins the CFG;
    - a macro whose full expansion is *expression-shaped* is reduced
      to a placeholder that preserves exactly what the analysis needs:
      an evaluated read of the claimed variable stays a read,
      occurrences inside ``typeof``/``__typeof__`` operands are
      unevaluated and disappear, and any assignment to / address-of
      the claimed variable inside a macro body refuses the proof.

    Expansion is refused — NO PROOF, never a guess — on: a macro name
    with conflicting definitions anywhere in the closure, a macro that
    is ``#undef``-ed, an expansion containing control-flow escape
    tokens (``goto``/``return``/``break``/``continue``/``switch``/
    labels/``asm``), unsupported preprocessor constructs, or any
    budget/cap overrun.

2.  **CFG walk (definite assignment).**  The expanded function is
    parsed with tree-sitter C; any parse error refuses.  A recursive
    abstract walk tracks the set of unassigned path contexts (each a
    set of branch conditions with polarity) through the structured
    statement forms.  Whole-variable assignment (``v = expr`` with the
    bare identifier on the left) is the only assigning form; writes to
    members/elements never assign the whole variable.  Every evaluated
    occurrence of the variable that is not the bare left-hand side of
    such an assignment is a use; a use reachable with a non-empty
    unassigned context set is a violation.

3.  **Optional Z3 arm.**  When the structural walk finds violations,
    each violating path's branch conditions are checked for joint
    satisfiability (:mod:`core.smt_solver.path_feasibility`).  If every
    such path is infeasible the property still holds.  The arm is
    heavily fenced: it runs only when no macro reduction occurred, no
    keyword-named macro exists in the closure, and only over
    conditions whose every variable is a PARAMETER of ISO-C integer
    type that is never reassigned in the function — locals can be
    indeterminate at the read and function-scope externs can change
    between reads, so joint unsatisfiability over such reads is not a
    refutation — with a single consistent width/signedness profile.
    Without z3, or on any vetting failure, the arm degrades to "no
    proof" — never to a weaker "proof".

Refused constructs (always NO PROOF)
------------------------------------

``goto`` / labels / ``switch`` (fallthrough and missing-default
semantics), ``asm``, ``setjmp``/``longjmp`` family, address-of the
claimed variable (a callee could assign through the pointer),
compound/update assignments to the claimed variable, assignment to the
claimed variable under a short-circuit operator, statement expressions
in the original source, preprocessor directives inside the function,
variable shadowing, VLA-shaped ``typeof`` operands, and any statement
form outside the structured allowlist.

Soundness bound (documented, deliberate)
----------------------------------------

The macro table is textual: it covers definitions the include-closure
scan can read.  Headers the scan cannot resolve (generated headers,
build-system include paths, ``-D`` command-line definitions) can hide
a macro this module then mistakes for a plain function call or
identifier.  Config-conditional definitions cut both ways: a
``#define`` collected from an inactive preprocessor branch expands as
written rather than as built, and the divergent build need not
involve anything invisible OR any conflicting definition — the
config-guarded-macro-with-function-fallback idiom compiles a by-value
CALL (which cannot assign a local) where the text shows an assigning
macro.  That third route is refused mechanically when the fallback is
closure-visible (a macro name that is also a declared function is a
conflict); a fallback living in another translation unit with no
closure-visible declaration remains open.  A benign tree gains
nothing from these gaps — the analysed text is the code as written —
but a crafted tree could plant divergence, so consumers gate the
proof on an operator repo-trust assertion, exactly like the other
witness whose soundness assumes non-adversarial target code.
