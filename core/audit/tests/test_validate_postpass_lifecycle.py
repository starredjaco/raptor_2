"""/audit → /validate post-pass lifecycle seam — hermetic end-to-end.

The post-pass is a CHILD phase of a live parent run: its lifecycle
start must land in the PARENT RUN's pinned project. Pre-fix the child
``raptor-run-lifecycle start`` re-resolved the project ambiently
(session binding, then the last-activated ``.active`` default); when
another session bumped the machine-wide default mid-run, the child
resolved a DIFFERENT project whose target-match gate refused the
start ("target ... is outside project ...") — the post-pass then
skipped with ``skipped_reason="lifecycle start failed"`` and every
emitted finding stayed unvalidated.

Real ``raptor-run-lifecycle`` subprocesses run against a temp HOME +
RAPTOR_OUT_DIR (registry, ``.active`` symlink, sessions dir all under
the temp home); only the sandboxed ``claude -p`` dispatch is faked —
the pipeline plumbing is under test, not the LLM.
