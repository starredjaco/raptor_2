"""Lifetime witness family for the anti-self-refutation gate (C).

Corroborates a reviewer's SELF-REFUTATION of a lifetime claim
(double-free / use-after-free, CWE-415/416) on a C function by proving
a mechanical control-flow fact over a goto/label-resolved
intra-function CFG.  When a witness holds, the dismissed claim's
mechanism is impossible as stated, so re-flagging it via the
receipt-free CWE-allowlist floor would manufacture a false positive.

Four arms over one shared substrate:

W-FREEPATH (double-free)
    Every pair of visible release sites of the claimed pointer is
    path-exclusive: no execution reaches two of them, and no loop
    encloses one.  Discharges pure double-free claims about this
    function's own free sites (the two-site typestate-echo shape) —
    CWE-415 only.  Mixed UAF/double-free phrasings are out of family.

W-NOUSE (use-after-release)
    No use of the claimed pointer — or of anything that could still
    reach it — on any path after the releasing call.  Tracking is
    deliberately over-approximate: bare-copy aliases propagate fully;
    values derived through calls/expressions and the possibly-retaining
    co-arguments of any call that received the pointer refuse the proof
    when they are dereferenced, indexed, or passed onward after the
    release.  A store of the pointer into memory, or its address being
    taken, refuses outright.  Discharges CWE-416.

W-BRACKET (acquire-release pairing)
    The claimed "free" is a put/unpin-family call paired with a
    get/pin-family acquisition that is the pointer's single definition
    and dominates every release.  No two releases through the same
    callee can both execute, no release sits in a loop, and after the
    final release nothing uses the pointer.  Stores of the pointer into
    longer-lived objects are permitted — a refcount drop paired with an
    acquisition is not a deallocation, and the claim being discharged
    is the in-function freed-then-used echo.  Discharges CWE-415/416.

W-DELEG (delegation-only)
    The function body is a single forwarding call of the function's own
    parameter to a free-family callee — it adds no lifetime behaviour
    of its own, so a "the framework/caller invokes this twice" double-
    free claim has no in-function mechanism and belongs to the caller's
    verdict lane.  Discharges CWE-415 for exactly that claim shape.

Async-handoff sub-arm (W-NOUSE variant)
    For claims about an asynchronous-completion path selected by a
    handoff sentinel (``-EINPROGRESS``): every path from the sentinel
    test to function exit contains zero release-family calls and never
    touches the claimed objects.  Discharges CWE-415/416 for the
    sentinel-path claim shape.

Applicability fences (claim phrasing) decide only which dismissals an
arm may EXAMINE — the proof is always the mechanical CFG analysis.
Claims attributing the free or the use to a concurrent actor are out
of family for the synchronous arms: a path proof says nothing about
another thread.

Macro certification
-------------------

The CFG is built from the RAW function source (tree-sitter C), so
every macro invocation must first be certified against the target
tree's own macro table (:mod:`core.audit.defassign` include-closure
machinery).  A macro whose definition cannot be proven inert for this
analysis refuses the whole claim: conflicting/poisoned definitions,
control-transfer tokens or labels in the (transitively resolved) body,
token pasting, a body that names one of the reviewed function's own
locals, a hidden release-family call, or an assignment/address-of
through a macro parameter whose argument is a tracked name.  Kernel
iteration macros (``IDENT(args) { ... }`` at statement position) are
certified the same way and then modelled as a conservative ``while``
loop — a superset of any iteration count the real expansion produces,
sound for the universally-quantified negatives proven here provided
the certified header transfers control only into its own loop.

Soundness bounds (documented, deliberate)
-----------------------------------------

- The macro table is textual (same residual class as the
  definite-assignment prover): headers the closure scan cannot read
  can hide a macro this module then treats as a plain call or
  identifier.  Consumers therefore gate the witness on the operator's
  repo-trust assertion.
- A release performed by a NAMED CALLEE the vocabulary does not cover
  is invisible: W-FREEPATH's obligation is the claimed in-function
  site pair (the fence restricts it to that claim shape), and
  W-NOUSE's obligation is what happens AFTER the visible releasing
  call — neither claims whole-program lifetime correctness.
- A macro body may assign a value derived from its arguments to a
  file-scope object; the after-release occurrence scan does not see
  such a stash.  Same trust-gate class as the textual-table residual.

Failure direction is uniformly conservative: every unresolvable
construct refuses ("no witness") — the floor stands.  Vocabulary is
seed-small (the shared free-verb seeds plus ``deactivate_locked_super``
for releases; ``get``/``pin`` vs ``put``/``unpin`` word stems for the
bracket arm) and grows only through the study-learned
DomainVocabulary, never from claim text.
