"""Recursive enumeration over the untrusted repo — symlink and cap
containment.

Detection and synthesis run in the UNSANDBOXED parent, so the walk
itself is a security boundary: a scanned repo containing ``src -> /``
must not steer enumeration into the host filesystem (directory-
symlink recursion is opt-in for ``Path.rglob`` — 3.13's
``recurse_symlinks=True``; ``glob.glob(recursive=True)`` is what
followed them by default — and these tests pin the no-follow
behaviour), and a hostile file farm must not monopolise detection
wall time.
