    a usable instance. Two surprises that fell out of that:

      * ``cfg = RaptorConfig(); cfg.SOMETHING = 42`` set the
        attribute on the INSTANCE, while every internal site
        reads `RaptorConfig.SOMETHING` (the class attribute) —
        so the override silently no-ops with no error. Operators
        debugging a "my override isn't taking effect" issue had
        no signal that the override sites were reading past the
        instance.
      * Test fixtures that did ``cfg = RaptorConfig()`` to scope
        a `patch.object(cfg, "X", ...)` similarly mutated the
        instance, leaving production code unaffected.

    Block instantiation explicitly so the misuse fails fast at
    the call site instead of producing a phantom instance.

    # has no ``.git`` to derive from — reports.

    # ``effective_version()`` is what the running tool should report/display.
    # In a git checkout it derives the true position relative to the last
    # release tag (e.g. ``3.0.0-1786-g7fcf38ea``) so a clone that is many
    # commits past a release never masquerades as that clean release. It falls

    # Since the allowlist (SAFE_ENV_ALLOWLIST) is now the primary subprocess
    # defense, every entry here is *redundant* for the sanitise-os.environ
    # path: none of these names are in the allowlist, so get_safe_env()
    # would drop them regardless. The list is kept because it still does
    # real work elsewhere:
    #   1. packages/codeql/database_manager.py — layers build-system-
    #      reported env vars on top of get_safe_env(), filtered through
    #      this blocklist to stop a malicious repo from re-injecting
    #      LD_PRELOAD / PYTHONUSERBASE / etc. via its build metadata.
    #   2. Future repo-content scanning — `.envrc`, `Dockerfile` ENV lines,
    #      CI workflow env sections can all set dangerous vars; this list
    #      is the authoritative reference for what to flag.
    #   3. Belt + braces inside get_safe_env() — if the allowlist is ever
    #      widened (e.g., a new `SSH_*` prefix) the overlay still strips
    #      the specific known-bad names.

             future unknown injection vectors (new runtime auto-load env
             vars, new tools that consult ambient state) cannot flow
             through unless we explicitly add them.

             Belt + braces against an accidentally-over-broad allowlist
             prefix. By default also strips proxy vars (HTTP_PROXY,
             HTTPS_PROXY, NO_PROXY) — most subprocesses (codeql build,
             fuzzing harness, gdb) shouldn't be making outbound HTTP
             on the operator's behalf, and a proxy that was set for
             interactive use can leak through.

        ``preserve_proxy=True`` keeps the proxy vars in the returned
        env. Use only for subprocesses that legitimately need to
        proxy outbound HTTP — typically the egress wrapper, the
        sandbox proxy itself, or LLM clients that need to honour
        an operator's HTTPS_PROXY setting. The dangerous-env-var
        strip still applies.

        ``PYTHONUSERBASE`` variable from the original os.environ
        AFTER the dangerous-env-vars strip. Use only at scanner
        invocation sites that legitimately depend on a
        ``pip install --user`` tool (e.g. semgrep). The variable is
        a real RCE vector via .pth files (see DANGEROUS_ENV_VARS
        comment at PYTHONUSERBASE) and stays stripped by default;
        but if the operator deliberately installed the scanner under
        ``~/.local`` with a non-default ``PYTHONUSERBASE`` set, the
        subprocess fails ``ModuleNotFoundError`` without this opt-in.
        Mirrors the ``preserve_proxy`` opt-in pattern.

        Callers who need a specific extra var (JAVA_HOME for a Java tool,
        a custom CA bundle, etc.) should add it to the returned dict
        explicitly after calling get_safe_env(), or pass their own env=

    ``TypeError: _run_smt_verb_inner() got an unexpected keyword
    argument`` because the child imported a stale checkout's
    ``core.audit.sweep``). Children of THIS process must import THIS
    tree, so the value is SET — never ``setdefault``'d — with a
    one-line notice the first time a differing ambient value is
