        Anthropic's published cacheable-region minimum is 1024 tokens
        (Opus / Sonnet) or 2048 (Haiku 3.5). Empirically (2026-05-04)
        some model versions enforce a higher de-facto minimum and
        return ``cache_creation_input_tokens=0,
        cache_read_input_tokens=0`` for cache_control opt-ins below
        that minimum, with no error — silent no-op. Consumers planning
        cost budgets around cache savings (cve-diff is the headline
        case) won't see the savings, with no signal until the bill
        comes in.

        Warn once per provider instance when all conditions hold:
          * ``cache_control`` was opt-in (caller asked for caching)
          * ``input_tokens >= 8192`` — well above any observed model's
            de-facto minimum, so a zero-cache outcome is a real signal,
            not a "your request was too small" false positive
          * ``cache_creation_input_tokens == 0`` AND
            ``cache_read_input_tokens == 0``

        The 8192 floor trades sensitivity for specificity: smaller
        cacheable regions that legitimately fall below a model's
        minimum won't trigger spurious warnings, but real silent-
        no-op cases on production-sized prompts (cve-diff: 5K+ tokens
        of system + tools) still surface.

        Scope: per-provider-instance. Each ``LLMClient`` builds its
        own provider via ``_get_provider``, and a fresh agentic run
        typically constructs a fresh client. Operators running the
        same setup repeatedly will see the warning once per run —
        loud enough to act on, not so loud as to hide in noise. A
        cross-process / cross-run dedup would need module-level
        state and isn't worth the complexity for a one-time signal.

    # The ABC's JSON-in-prompt synthesis (``_tool_use_fallback``) does
    # *not* work for Claude Code. CC has anti-prompt-injection training
    # that refuses to roleplay as a different agent system when a system
    # prompt says "you have these tools, emit JSON to call them" — that
    # framing is indistinguishable from an attacker injecting a fake
    # tool schema, and CC correctly refuses.
    #
    # The fix: reframe the task as *structured output* via CC's
    # ``--json-schema`` flag. Anti-injection guards roleplay, not
    # form-filling. We give CC a discriminated-union schema (either
    # ``tool_call`` or ``complete``) plus the tool catalog as
    # reference material, and CC fills in the form. Verified
    # empirically: CC honours the schema and produces valid tool
    # calls or final answers for typical agent flows.
