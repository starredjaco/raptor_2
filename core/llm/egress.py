"""Route in-process LLM SDK calls (anthropic, openai, google-genai)
through RAPTOR's existing in-process egress proxy.

Why this exists
---------------
``packages/llm_analysis/cc_dispatch.py`` already routes the Claude Code
subprocess through the in-process proxy (``use_egress_proxy=True,
proxy_hosts=["api.anthropic.com"]``). The OTHER LLM consumers — direct
in-process SDK calls used by /agentic external-LLM dispatch, /codeql's
autonomous_analyzer, etc. — have historically gone direct, with no
chokepoint to enforce hostname allowlist or surface egress for audit.

This module closes that gap by setting ``HTTPS_PROXY`` — and
``HTTP_PROXY``, so plain ``http://`` endpoints cannot slip past the
chokepoint by consulting the un-set variable — in the parent process
env to point at the same in-process proxy CC already uses.
``httpx``-based SDKs (anthropic, openai, google-genai all use httpx
under the hood) honour the env vars and route accordingly.

Hostname allowlist comes from ``LLMConfig`` itself — the operator's own
configured ``api_base`` per ``ModelConfig`` is the authoritative
source. Operators who route through LiteLLM proxy / corporate gateway
/ vLLM by setting ``api_base`` automatically get that hostname
allowlisted; defaults from :data:`PROVIDER_ENDPOINTS` cover the
unconfigured case.

No TLS interception
-------------------
The in-process proxy is a CONNECT-tunnel proxy: it sees host:port for
allowlist enforcement and audit logging, but never decrypts the
TLS body. So no CA injection is needed; SDK trust-store behaviour is
unchanged. Cert pinning is irrelevant. (TLS-intercepting MITM is the
separately-tracked /web feature.)

Subprocess interaction
----------------------
``RaptorConfig.get_safe_env()`` strips ``HTTPS_PROXY`` from subprocess
envs as a defence against env-injection attacks (a malicious target
repo's ``.claude/settings.json`` could otherwise redirect a CodeQL
build subprocess to an attacker proxy). That stripping is at a
DIFFERENT layer from this module — we set ``HTTPS_PROXY`` in the
parent process for the in-process LLM SDKs; subprocess builds do not
inherit it. The two co-exist cleanly.

Corporate-proxy chaining
------------------------
If the operator has ``HTTPS_PROXY=http://corp:8080`` set when RAPTOR
launches, the in-process proxy reads it at first-construction time and
chains through it for upstream connections. We MUST call
``get_proxy()`` BEFORE overwriting ``HTTPS_PROXY`` — otherwise the
proxy reads its own pointer and loops. Order is enforced in
:func:`enable_llm_egress`.

Process-wide effect on non-LLM HTTP callers
-------------------------------------------
Setting ``HTTPS_PROXY`` in ``os.environ`` affects every ``httpx`` /
``requests`` caller in the same process, not just the LLM SDKs we
intend to gate. Audit performed 2026-05-07:

  * ``core.startup.init._test_key`` — hits the LLM provider hosts
    (api.anthropic.com, api.openai.com, api.mistral.ai, ...). All in
    the allowlist (they're the configured providers). Tunneled
    through the chokepoint cleanly.
  * ``core.llm.detection.detect_llm_availability`` (Ollama) — hits
    ``localhost:11434``. Bypassed via the ``NO_PROXY`` augmentation
    so this still works.
  * ``core.sage.client`` (httpx.get on the configured SAGE URL) —
    default ``http://localhost:8090`` is bypassed via ``NO_PROXY``.
    For remote SAGE URLs, ``SageClient.__init__`` calls
    ``get_proxy([sage_host])`` to add the host to the in-process
    proxy's allowlist, so SAGE's health check + SDK calls flow
    through the same chokepoint cleanly.
  * ``packages.cve_diff`` — uses its own ``ResilientLLMClient`` that
    calls ``create_provider`` directly, never constructing
    ``LLMClient``, so this module's ``enable_llm_egress`` never
    fires for cve-diff. cve-diff retains direct egress.
  * ``core.git.clone`` — git runs as a sandboxed subprocess with
    its own sanitised env (``RaptorConfig.get_git_env()``); parent
    HTTPS_PROXY is not inherited.
