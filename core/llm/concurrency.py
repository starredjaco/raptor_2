    A HEURISTIC for a startup banner and default selection only —
    never a gate, and never blocks a run. A record counts only while
    (a) its session entry verifies live (identity stamp / kill-0 —
    see ``ledger_running_runs_all_sessions``), (b) the run dir's own
    ``.raptor-run.json`` still says ``running``, and (c) the recorded
    command is in :data:`LLM_RUN_COMMANDS`. Staleness tolerance: the
    metadata re-vet in (b) filters runs that finalised without a
    ledger finish, but a run that crashed leaving ``status=running``
    IN ITS METADATA is over-counted until its owning session exits
    (the ledger's session-liveness gate) or the project's
    ``_cleanup_abandoned`` sweep corrects the metadata — bounded, and
    the cost is one conservative banner line, not a blocked run.
    Fail-open: any read failure returns ``count=None``.

    ``self_run_dir`` excludes the calling run's own ledger record.
