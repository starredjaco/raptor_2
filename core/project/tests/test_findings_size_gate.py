"""Per-file byte gate on findings loaders.

Import admits archives up to a 10 GiB aggregate extraction budget;
report/merge generation then ``load_json``'s each run's
findings.json wholesale. Pre-fix there was no per-file bound, so one
huge restored findings.json OOM'd the reporting step. The loaders
now stat the file first and skip (with a warning) anything over
``MAX_FINDINGS_JSON_BYTES`` before parsing.
